### [Using Vertex AI to evaluate an example A2A Agent](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Using-Vertex-AI-to-evaluate-an-example-A2A-Agent/ba-p/927880)

Previously, we explored why trajectory evaluation and handoffs are
critical for multi-agent systems. In our latest post, we move from
theory to practice, showing you exactly how to evaluate agent2agent
(A2A) agents. We'll guide you through a hands-on example, building and
assessing a Reimbursement Agent using the power of Vertex AI Evaluation
services. Dive into our Colab notebook to learn how to set up and run
your own evaluations, ensuring your multi-agent systems perform
flawlessly.

### [How to build AI agents with long-term memory using Vertex AI Memory Bank & ADK](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/How-to-build-AI-agents-with-long-term-memory-using-Vertex-AI/ba-p/923630)

Is your AI agent suffering from amnesia? Don't let your users get stuck
in a conversational loop. It's time to stop relying on clunky, expensive
context windows that lead to "context rot." This guide introduces the
Vertex AI Agent Engine Memory Bank. Learn how to build agents that
remember and recall information across conversations. We'll show you how
to generate, store, and retrieve memories, creating an enhanced user
experience. Ready to build agents that truly connect? Let's get started.

### [Protect your LLM applications with Google Cloud Services](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Protect-your-LLM-applications-with-Google-Cloud-Services/ba-p/924663)

Generative AI offers immense power, but with it comes significant risk.
This article discuss how to protect your LLM applications from prompt
injection, data leakage, and other threats using a multi-layered
security approach with Google Cloud services like Natural Language API,
Model Armor, and vector databases.

### [Evaluating success in a multi-agent system: Why trajectory assessment and handoffs matters](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Evaluating-success-in-a-multi-agent-system-Why-trajectory/ba-p/924955)

Your AI agents are only as good as their ability to collaborate. As we
move from single agents using tools to multi-agent ecosystems, our
methods for evaluating success must evolve. Learn why trajectory and
handoffs matter more than ever.

### [Media CDN flexible origin shielding: Reducing origin load, latency, and improving viewer experience](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Media-CDN-flexible-origin-shielding-Reducing-origin-load-latency/ba-p/922698)

Discover how Media CDN's new flexible origin shielding enhances content
delivery! Learn how to reduce origin load, optimize latency, and improve
viewer experience by precisely controlling your shield locations.

### [Agents are not tools](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Agents-are-not-tools/ba-p/922716)

There is a common refrain from many that “why can’t agents just be
tools?”. This blog provides a point of view about why tools and agents
should be treated differently, and why there needs to be a different way
to interact with them.

### [Optimizing LLMs serving with the new NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM container on Vertex AI](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Optimizing-LLMs-serving-with-the-new-NVIDIA-TensorRT-LLM/ba-p/922254)

inference directly into Vertex AI Prediction, enabling you to serve open
models with 1-click deployment and getting significantly improved
performance and cost-efficiency.

### [Deeper Insights with knowledge engine & dataset-level metadata in BQ](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Deeper-Insights-with-knowledge-engine-amp-dataset-level-metadata/ba-p/918864)

In my previous blog From Data to Metadata: Unlocking Insights with Gen
AI in BigQuery, we explored how BigQuery's “Insights” feature can
automatically generate metadata for your tables and columns helping to
uncover hidden patterns and trends within your data. We are now taking
it a step further with metadata and insights generation at the dataset
level. This new capability not only describes the dataset but also
provides an interactive entity relationship map that visually reveals
connections between different entities.

### [A developer's guide for building with Anthropic’s Claude 4 models on Vertex AI](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/A-developer-s-guide-for-building-with-Anthropic-s-Claude-4/ba-p/918348)

We recently announced the general availability of two new models from
the latest generation of Anthropic’s Claude model family on Vertex AI:
Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. In this blog, we’ll guide you through
building with the new Claude 4 models on Vertex AI.

Text: When it comes to open source technology, Google is topping the charts on the Open Source Contribution Index. But beyond their open-source contributions, Google also offers an impressive array of **tools** that many developers may not even know about. In this blog post, we’ll shine a spotlight on my selection of 10 tools for **AI Developers**. Whether you’re a seasoned coder or just starting out, these tools are definitely worth exploring and incorporating into your workflow. Let’s dive in!

Zoom image will be displayed

## **1\. Google AI Studio:** [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)

[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) is a browser-based IDE for prototyping with generative models from Google. This includes both best in class **Gemini** models as well as **Gemma**, which represents a family of lightweight, state-of-the art **open models** built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Ideal environment for validating business prototypes experimenting with prompt engineering, fine-tuning...

Zoom image will be displayed

However, as your generative AI solutions mature, you may need a platform for building and deploying generative AI applications and solutions end to end. And this is when you may need **Google Cloud. Google Cloud** provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools to enable developers to harness the power of generative AI, from the initial stages of app development to app deployment, app hosting, and managing complex data at scale. You will want to transition to **Vertex AI platform** which offers a suite of MLOps tools that streamline usage, deployment, and monitoring of AI models for efficiency and reliability. Google Cloud will also give you native integrations with databases, DevOps tools, logging, monitoring, and IAM meaning it will provide a holistic approach to managing the entire generative AI lifecycle.

## 2\. **IDX:** [https://idx.google.com/](https://idx.google.com/)

**Project IDX** is an AI-assisted, entirely web-based workspace for full-stack, multiplatform app development in the cloud.

What is there fore you? You can build and deploy applications in various tech stacks **without the tedium of setting up development environments** for yourself and others on your team.

IDX uses Google Cloud to keep your development environment reliable, safe, and fully customizable, but you don’t need Google Cloud account to use it! It utilizes the same environment as Google Cloud Workstations which is a cloud service providing fully managed development environments **built to meet the needs of security-sensitive enterprises**. Cloud Workstations allow you to develop and run code inside your **private network** and in your staging environment, so you don’t need to emulate your services. You can also enforce “ **no source code on local devices**” policies and bring the same security mechanisms used for production workloads to your development environments, such as VPC Service Controls (VPC SC), private ingress/egress, Cloud Audit Logs, and granular IAM controls.

## 3\. **Colabs:** [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

**Colab** is a web-based Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides **free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs**. Colab is especially well suited to machine learning, data science, and education (e.g. to lean python, JAX, Tensorflow, Pytorch…).

If you need:

1. More compute units
2. Faster GPUs
3. More memory
4. Terminal access
5. Background execution

then these will be available from **Google Workspace**:

or Google Cloud Vertex AI Colabs:

## **4\.** [**Visual Blocks for ML**](https://visualblocks.withgoogle.com/\#/%23top) **:** [https://visualblocks.withgoogle.com/\#/](https://visualblocks.withgoogle.com/\#/)

This one has such a huge potential! Visual Blocks for ML is a Google visual programming framework that lets you create ML pipelines using a no-code graph editor. You can quickly prototype workflows by connecting drag-and-drop **ML components for vision, text, audio and video**, including models, user inputs, processors, and visualizations. You can also code your custom ML components. What is extremely helpful is the fact that you can run your pipelines in real-time in your browser and preview results at each step. This streamlines the development and debugging process, allowing you to quickly identify issues and iterate on your pipelines without the need for constant code re-execution and waiting for results.

Zoom image will be displayed

If you would like to use this from your laptop or from **Google Cloud** then **Visual Blocks** can be installed into any Jupyter Notebook, including Colabs available from Workspace or Vertex AI:

## 5. **LLM Comparator:** [https://pair-code.github.io/llm-comparator/](https://pair-code.github.io/llm-comparator/)

Code: [https://github.com/PAIR-code/llm-comparator](https://github.com/PAIR-code/llm-comparator)

**LLM Comparator** is an interactive visualization tool with a python library, for analyzing **side-by-side LLM evaluation results**. It is designed to help people **qualitatively analyze how responses from two models differ** at example- and slice-levels. Users can interactively discover insights like _“Model A’s responses are better than B’s on email rewriting tasks because Model A tends to generate bulleted lists more often.”_

Zoom image will be displayed

**Why side-by-side LLM evaluation?** The notion that your AI model is always superior is a common misconception fueled by the rapid advancements and marketing hype surrounding artificial intelligence. In reality, the AI landscape is vast and diverse, with a multitude of models excelling in different areas. The only way to find out which model works best for you is to measure its performance on your use case and then consider other factors like latency, cost, ease of use, stability, availability ….. But the very first step is to measure if you assumptions hold true.

In fact when you think about it, all these shows that it’s not just about the model itself; it’s about the **platform that empowers you to create trustworthy AI applications and guides you in making informed choices**. **Vertex AI exemplifies this**, offering a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to build, deploy, and manage AI models effectively. It’s the platform that truly unlocks the potential of AI, not just the model alone.

One of the tools it offers to make informed decisions about the model is automated side by side (AutoSxS) comparison of distinct models on your inputs.

To understand how it works, imagine you and your friend are playing a drawing game. You both get the same instructions, like “draw a cat wearing a hat,” and you both draw your own versions. Now, imagine there’s a third person, like a teacher or a parent, who looks at both drawings and decides which one is better.

In the world of AI, this is kind of like how AutoSxS works. There are two AI models, let’s call them Model A and Model B. They both get the same instructions, or “prompts”. Each model writes its own response, just like you and your friend drew your own cats.

Then, there’s another AI model, called the “autorater”. This is like the teacher or parent in our drawing game. The autorater looks at both stories and decides which one is better. It does this by using a set of rules, or “criteria,” to judge things like how well the stories follow the instructions, how interesting they are, and how well they’re written:

[https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/side-by-side-eval](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/side-by-side-eval)

The autorater then tells us which model did a better job overall, and it can even explain why it chose one story over the other. It also tells us how confident it is in its decision, just like a teacher might say “I’m very sure your drawing is better” or “It’s a close call, but I think your friend’s drawing is slightly better.”

This is how AutoSxS helps us figure out which AI model is better at a particular task, like writing stories or answering questions. It’s like a fair and objective judge for AI models.

Once the rating is done you can visit Vertex AI console and see a list of your input questions, and for each question, you’ll know which model’s answer the autorater preferred. The autorater explains why it chose that answer and how confident it feels about its judgment. The win rate tells you which model overall performed better across all your questions.

Zoom image will be displayed

Remember, even though there’s only one winner per question, both models might give correct answers. It’s just that one answer might be better based on the criteria the autorater used, like being more informative or easier to understand. But remember this universal truth: you can not improve things that can’t be measured so make data driven decisions. AutoSxS is a very powerful tool in your toolkit.

So where is LLM Comparator needed? LLM Comparator tool computes aggregated statistics that help to understand when, how and why the winner is better.

## **6\. Firebase:** [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/)

**Firebase** is a comprehensive app development platform that is globally used by millions of mobile applications and websites. Firebase handles many backend tasks, such as **authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and hosting**, enabling developers to focus on creating compelling user experiences rather than building and managing complex infrastructure.

Zoom image will be displayed

For generative AI developers, Firebase becomes even more valuable when combined with tools like **Genkit** or native integration with **Vertex AI or Google AI Studio**.

**Few words about Genkit. Genkit** is a framework designed to simplify the integration of AI capabilities into applications. It is available as open source libraries for **Node.js and Go**, plus developer tools for testing and debugging

These tools help you:

- **Experiment:** Test and refine your AI functions, prompts, and queries.
- **Debug:** Find and fix issues with detailed execution traces.
- **Evaluate:** Assess generated results across multiple test cases.

## **7\. Mesop:** [https://google.github.io/mesop/](https://google.github.io/mesop/) (showcase: [https://wwwillchen-mesop-showcase.hf.space/](https://wwwillchen-mesop-showcase.hf.space/))

**Mesop** is a Python-based UI framework that allows you to rapidly build **web apps like demos and internal apps:**

- It is Open-Source,
- it is very easy to get started with pre-built components,
- it enables you to code in idiomatic Python,

## **8\. OneTwo:** [https://github.com/google-deepmind/onetwo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/onetwo)

OneTwo is a Python library designed to simplify interactions with large (language and multimodal) foundation models, **primarily aimed at researchers in _prompting_ and _prompting strategies_**.

Some properties of OneTwo that are particularly impactful for researcher productivity include the following:

- **Model-agnostic:** Provides a uniform API to access different models that can easily be swapped and compared.
- **Flexible:** Supports implementation of arbitrarily complex computation graphs involving combinations of sequential and parallel operations, including interleaving of calls to foundation models and to other tools.
- **Efficient:** Automatically optimizes request batching and other details of model server interactions under-the-hood for maximizing throughput, while allowing prompting strategies to be implemented straightforwardly, as if they were dealing with just single requests.
- **Reproducible:** Automatically caches requests/replies for easy stop-and-go or replay of experiments.

# A developer’s toolkit for building great applications on GCP

December 20, 2017

##### Girija Sathyamurthy

Product Marketing Manager

Whether you're looking to build your next big application, learn some really cool technology concepts or gain some hands-on development experience, [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) is a great development platform. But where do you start?

Lots of customers talk to us about their varying application development needs — for example, what are the best tools to use for web and mobile app development, how do I scale my application back-end and how do I add data processing and intelligence to my application? In this blog, we’ll share some resources to help you identify which products are best suited to your development goals.

To help you get started, here are a few resources such as quick start guides, videos and codelabs for services across web and mobile app development, developer tools, data processing and analytics and monitoring:

![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/application-platformnbqa.max-700x700.PNG](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/application-platformnbqa.max-700x700.PNG)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/application-platformnbqa.max-700x700.PNG](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/application-platformnbqa.max-700x700.PNG)

### Web and mobile app development

[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/

offers a fully managed serverless platform that allows you to build highly scalable web and mobile applications. If you're looking for a zero-config application hosting service that will let you auto-scale from zero to infinite-size without having to manage any infrastructure, look no further than App Engine.

- [Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PRciDpqpko)
- [Code labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?filter=app%20engine)

[Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) is another great event-driven serverless compute platform you can use to build microservices at the functions level, scale to infinite size and pay only for what you use. If you're looking for a lightweight compute platform to run your code in response to user actions, analytics, authentication events or for telemetry data collection, real-time processing and analysis, Cloud Functions has everything you need to be agile and productive.

- [Quick Start](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstarts)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CZ1f6wzn4Q)
- [Code labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?filter=functions)

### Build, deploy and debug

[Developer tools](https://cloud.google.com/products/tools/) provide plugins to build, deploy and debug code using your favorite IDEs, such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, Gradle and Maven. You can use either cloud SDK or a browser-based command line to build your apps. [Cloud Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/) that come as a part of developer tools let you host private Git repos and organize the associated code. Below are a sampling of resources, check out the [developer tools section for more](https://cloud.google.com/products/).

- [IntelliJ Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/tools/intellij/docs/quickstart-IDEA)
- [Maven plugin Github](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-maven-plugin)
- [Gradle plugin Github](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin)

### Data processing and analytics

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-p-dr-1002250&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_153585401984-ADGP_SKWS+%7C+Multi+~+null_Bigquery-KWID_43700017651054484-kwd-100021229365&utm_term=KW_bigquery-ST_bigQuery&dclid=CJmcpv6Eg9gCFUwwaQodnvYKMw) offers a fast, highly scalable, low cost and fully managed data warehouse on which you can perform analytics. [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) allows you to ingest event streams from anywhere, at any scale, for simple, reliable, real-time stream analytics. BigQuery and Pub/Sub work seamlessly with services like [Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-p-dr-1002250&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_214324741095-ADGP_SKWS+%7C+Multi+~+null_Machine+Learning+-+Broad-KWID_43700017656474433-kwd-117405139025&utm_term=KW_%2Bmachine%20%2Blearning-ST_%2Bmachine+%2Blearning&dclid=CPmNp-iIg9gCFYgoaQodGHMN6w) to help you add an intelligence layer to your application.

- [Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aupC-Wj7XDY)
- [Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?filter=BigQuery)

### Monitoring, logging and diagnostics

[Google Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/) provides powerful monitoring, logging and diagnostics. It equips you with insight into the health, performance and availability of cloud-powered applications, enabling you to find and fix issues faster. It's natively integrated with GCP, other cloud providers and popular open source packages.

- [Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6weNkNmC7s)
- [Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?filter=Stackdriver)

I hope this blog post has given you an overview of the different application development services available on GCP. [Sign up for your free trial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?bloglink=holiday-learning) today and get a $300 GCP credit.

Text: At Google Cloud, we recognize that building great products for your customers isn't just about writing and shipping code. It's the messy whiteboard sessions, the hallway conversations and email threads, deciding what to build and how. And after you launch, making sure your application is resilient, secure, and has a meaningful impact on your customers.

It's been a fast-moving year for generative AI. With so many tools hitting the market, you might be asking whether all these new things can actually be useful in real life. After all, people — not machines — are at the heart of great software.

With that in mind, let's walk through a day in the life of a Google Cloud developer using Google AI assistance to get from idea to production.

Imagine that I'm a software engineer at **Cymbal Superstore,** a grocery retailer.

Our website runs on Google Cloud, and I've been tasked to add a _new products page_ showcasing the latest snacks. It's 9AM on Monday, I've got my coffee — let's do this.

## **Design together**

The feature request has landed in my inbox. I use [Gmail's **help me write** feature](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/13384326) to quickly respond.

Then, I hop into a meeting room with my teammate, and we start brainstorming the implementation on a whiteboard.

Now I'm ready to write a design doc. My teammate has to run to a meeting, but I want to bounce around some questions about our architecture. I open [**Bard**](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwj5nMSW-7uBAxWv_-MHHVT7B4gYABAAGgJ5bQ&gclid=Cj0KCQjw06-oBhC6ARIsAGuzdw2pg4RmnA5FMtWozWVY9m4NLx_cLMqc31VUiUOsbrjHEKP00YLJSBgaArGdEALw_wcB&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbOD2p6pW8zJhpprHArh89n65XzGRfuTLXXWbG-Zwe-gYuGP9Gby8Y3y9HqKC3pX8DPpj28Hp7pUiNDpy6awLQ1j1UAoQqMktrdyfwPojwNrde5CEAVWQktXc6kUWoif4GrO8gxXEyu1PWUTH0A&sig=AOD64_3YDWSfYeVmYKOcNtj1DfY_qXHZNg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjz47mW-7uBAxULk4kEHXekAGYQ0Qx6BAgIEAE), and [use **Google Lens**](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-new-features-update-july-2023/) to upload my architecture diagram. Bard reads my architecture diagram, and I have a quick chat with Bard about any potential risks with my proposed implementation.

From there, I export my Bard conversation to Google Docs to start the design doc. I use [Google Docs **Help me write**](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13623623#zippy=%2Cget-started-writing-with-duet-ai-in-google-docs) to generate an outline. This time-saving feature lets me focus on the tricky design questions, like how we might cache [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore) queries on the backend.

By midday, I've sent my design doc to my team for review. Meanwhile, the UX team has been working on a frontend mock for the New Products page.

By the time my design doc is approved, I have a frontend page ready to start testing against. Let's get coding.

## **Code (with help)**

Writing code can be a solitary thing. And although I'm a seasoned TypeScript engineer, I'm fairly new to Google Cloud, and I often find myself with fifty tabs open — documentation, StackOverflow, calming music — just to write 10 lines of code. Let's explore how [Duet AI for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/duet-ai-in-google-cloud-preview) can help me out.

I launch my development environment from [Google Cloud Workstations](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/overview) and open a code editor. First, I use [**Duet AI in Apigee**](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/introducing-duet-ai-in-apigee-api-management-and-application-integration) to auto-generate an OpenAPI spec for the new REST API endpoint. Then, I use a [swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-typescript-api) generator to auto-create TypeScript stub code from that spec.

Now I'm ready to implement the business logic. I use [Duet AI's **code generation**](https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai/docs/create-app-duet-ai#modify-app) to prompt, via code comment, the Firestore query I want. I press _tab_ to accept Duet AI's code suggestions.

Then, I test my code locally — uh oh. I see an error.

I'm not sure what the error means, so I open [**Duet AI chat**](https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai/docs/create-app-duet-ai#run-app-locally) from within my IDE. Duet AI is trained on Google Cloud documentation and sample code, and can help me figure out not only what the error means, but how to fix it in my code — no frantic Googling required.

Once I fix the error, I can use the same Duet AI chat thread to help me write a **test case** for the new endpoint. Duet AI can tailor its response using the contents of my open test file, generating a test that uses the same framework and format as my other tests.

With Duet AI's help, I can get to a working prototype faster because it requires less context-switching out of the IDE.

## **Operate with confidence**

I commit my code to source control, then work through a code review with my teammate. I merge in the new feature, and the New Products page rolls out to production. Hooray. But the software development lifecycle doesn't end here.

As an app developer who will be on-call for this production service, the first thing I want to find are the service logs. I use Duet AI's **console chat** feature to help me navigate the Cloud Run console.

Then, I work with the SRE team to create some [service-level objectives](https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/) for the Inventory service. In Cloud Monitoring. I use Duet AI's **help me modify** feature to create complex queries on my service health. As a non-expert in [PromQL](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/promql), this feature can save me a ton of time looking up [the right syntax.](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)

What about security? Let's say that last week during a debugging session, I granted my teammate a temporary, permissive IAM role in my Google Cloud project. [Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center) can pick up on this. With Duet AI's [AI-generated summaries,](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-security-command-center-overview#ai-summaries) I can quickly understand the issue, and work with the security team to remediate.

## **Share the impact**

A week goes by, and the product lead has asked me to present a few slides at the upcoming all hands. I work with my business analyst colleague to prepare. We want to understand the impact of creating a new products showcase — did those new products sell better after being featured on their own dedicated page?

We start by creating a to-do list in **Google Sheets**, using the [**help me organize**](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13676332) feature.

Then, we dive into the sales data, using Duet AI in [Spanner's](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) **SQL code completion** feature to query the raw transactions data from the last few weeks.

We gather more data from the sales rollup tables in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). As the business analyst writes SQL queries with expert ease, I use Duet's [**code explanation**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-sql-duet-ai#explain_a_sql_query) feature to better understand the data we're gathering.

From there, I jump to Google Slides and use Duet AI's ["Help me visualize"](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13951829?hl=en) tool to generate supporting imagery for the impact report.

Text: When it comes to open source technology, Google is topping the charts on the Open Source Contribution Index. But beyond their open-source contributions, Google also offers an impressive array of **tools** that many developers may not even know about. In this blog post, we’ll shine a spotlight on my selection of 10 tools for **AI Developers**. Whether you’re a seasoned coder or just starting out, these tools are definitely worth exploring and incorporating into your workflow. Let’s dive in!

Zoom image will be displayed

## **1\. Google AI Studio:** [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)

[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) is a browser-based IDE for prototyping with generative models from Google. This includes both best in class **Gemini** models as well as **Gemma**, which represents a family of lightweight, state-of-the art **open models** built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Ideal environment for validating business prototypes experimenting with prompt engineering, fine-tuning...

Zoom image will be displayed

However, as your generative AI solutions mature, you may need a platform for building and deploying generative AI applications and solutions end to end. And this is when you may need **Google Cloud. Google Cloud** provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools to enable developers to harness the power of generative AI, from the initial stages of app development to app deployment, app hosting, and managing complex data at scale. You will want to transition to **Vertex AI platform** which offers a suite of MLOps tools that streamline usage, deployment, and monitoring of AI models for efficiency and reliability. Google Cloud will also give you native integrations with databases, DevOps tools, logging, monitoring, and IAM meaning it will provide a holistic approach to managing the entire generative AI lifecycle.

## 2\. **IDX:** [https://idx.google.com/](https://idx.google.com/)

**Project IDX** is an AI-assisted, entirely web-based workspace for full-stack, multiplatform app development in the cloud.

What is there fore you? You can build and deploy applications in various tech stacks **without the tedium of setting up development environments** for yourself and others on your team.

IDX uses Google Cloud to keep your development environment reliable, safe, and fully customizable, but you don’t need Google Cloud account to use it! It utilizes the same environment as Google Cloud Workstations which is a cloud service providing fully managed development environments **built to meet the needs of security-sensitive enterprises**. Cloud Workstations allow you to develop and run code inside your **private network** and in your staging environment, so you don’t need to emulate your services. You can also enforce “ **no source code on local devices**” policies and bring the same security mechanisms used for production workloads to your development environments, such as VPC Service Controls (VPC SC), private ingress/egress, Cloud Audit Logs, and granular IAM controls.

## 3\. **Colabs:** [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

**Colab** is a web-based Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides **free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs**. Colab is especially well suited to machine learning, data science, and education (e.g. to lean python, JAX, Tensorflow, Pytorch…).

If you need:

1. More compute units
2. Faster GPUs
3. More memory
4. Terminal access
5. Background execution

then these will be available from **Google Workspace**:

or Google Cloud Vertex AI Colabs:

## **4\.** [**Visual Blocks for ML**](https://visualblocks.withgoogle.com/\#/%23top) **:** [https://visualblocks.withgoogle.com/\#/](https://visualblocks.withgoogle.com/\#/)

This one has such a huge potential! Visual Blocks for ML is a Google visual programming framework that lets you create ML pipelines using a no-code graph editor. You can quickly prototype workflows by connecting drag-and-drop **ML components for vision, text, audio and video**, including models, user inputs, processors, and visualizations. You can also code your custom ML components. What is extremely helpful is the fact that you can run your pipelines in real-time in your browser and preview results at each step. This streamlines the development and debugging process, allowing you to quickly identify issues and iterate on your pipelines without the need for constant code re-execution and waiting for results.

Zoom image will be displayed

If you would like to use this from your laptop or from **Google Cloud** then **Visual Blocks** can be installed into any Jupyter Notebook, including Colabs available from Workspace or Vertex AI:

## 5. **LLM Comparator:** [https://pair-code.github.io/llm-comparator/](https://pair-code.github.io/llm-comparator/)

Code: [https://github.com/PAIR-code/llm-comparator](https://github.com/PAIR-code/llm-comparator)

**LLM Comparator** is an interactive visualization tool with a python library, for analyzing **side-by-side LLM evaluation results**. It is designed to help people **qualitatively analyze how responses from two models differ** at example- and slice-levels. Users can interactively discover insights like _“Model A’s responses are better than B’s on email rewriting tasks because Model A tends to generate bulleted lists more often.”_

Zoom image will be displayed

**Why side-by-side LLM evaluation?** The notion that your AI model is always superior is a common misconception fueled by the rapid advancements and marketing hype surrounding artificial intelligence. In reality, the AI landscape is vast and diverse, with a multitude of models excelling in different areas. The only way to find out which model works best for you is to measure its performance on your use case and then consider other factors like latency, cost, ease of use, stability, availability ….. But the very first step is to measure if you assumptions hold true.

In fact when you think about it, all these shows that it’s not just about the model itself; it’s about the **platform that empowers you to create trustworthy AI applications and guides you in making informed choices**. **Vertex AI exemplifies this**, offering a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to build, deploy, and manage AI models effectively. It’s the platform that truly unlocks the potential of AI, not just the model alone.

One of the tools it offers to make informed decisions about the model is automated side by side (AutoSxS) comparison of distinct models on your inputs.

To understand how it works, imagine you and your friend are playing a drawing game. You both get the same instructions, like “draw a cat wearing a hat,” and you both draw your own versions. Now, imagine there’s a third person, like a teacher or a parent, who looks at both drawings and decides which one is better.

In the world of AI, this is kind of like how AutoSxS works. There are two AI models, let’s call them Model A and Model B. They both get the same instructions, or “prompts”. Each model writes its own response, just like you and your friend drew your own cats.

Then, there’s another AI model, called the “autorater”. This is like the teacher or parent in our drawing game. The autorater looks at both stories and decides which one is better. It does this by using a set of rules, or “criteria,” to judge things like how well the stories follow the instructions, how interesting they are, and how well they’re written:

[https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/side-by-side-eval](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/side-by-side-eval)

The autorater then tells us which model did a better job overall, and it can even explain why it chose one story over the other. It also tells us how confident it is in its decision, just like a teacher might say “I’m very sure your drawing is better” or “It’s a close call, but I think your friend’s drawing is slightly better.”

This is how AutoSxS helps us figure out which AI model is better at a particular task, like writing stories or answering questions. It’s like a fair and objective judge for AI models.

Once the rating is done you can visit Vertex AI console and see a list of your input questions, and for each question, you’ll know which model’s answer the autorater preferred. The autorater explains why it chose that answer and how confident it feels about its judgment. The win rate tells you which model overall performed better across all your questions.

Remember, even though there’s only one winner per question, both models might give correct answers. It’s just that one answer might be better based on the criteria the autorater used, like being more informative or easier to understand. But remember this universal truth: you can not improve things that can’t be measured so make data driven decisions. AutoSxS is a very powerful tool in your toolkit.

So where is LLM Comparator needed? LLM Comparator tool computes aggregated statistics that help to understand when, how and why the winner is better.

## **6\. Firebase:** [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/)

**Firebase** is a comprehensive app development platform that is globally used by millions of mobile applications and websites. Firebase handles many backend tasks, such as **authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and hosting**, enabling developers to focus on creating compelling user experiences rather than building and managing complex infrastructure.

Zoom image will be displayed

For generative AI developers, Firebase becomes even more valuable when combined with tools like **Genkit** or native integration with **Vertex AI or Google AI Studio**.

**Few words about Genkit. Genkit** is a framework designed to simplify the integration of AI capabilities into applications. It is available as open source libraries for **Node.js and Go**, plus developer tools for testing and debugging

These tools help you:

- **Experiment:** Test and refine your AI functions, prompts, and queries.
- **Debug:** Find and fix issues with detailed execution traces.
- **Evaluate:** Assess generated results across multiple test cases.

**Mesop** is a Python-based UI framework that allows you to rapidly build **web apps like demos and internal apps:**

- It is Open-Source,
- it is very easy to get started with pre-built components,
- it enables you to code in idiomatic Python,
- it supports hot-reloads,
- its components are basically Python Functions,
- it is fast and built on Angular.
- It is my default choice whenever I need to build something that requires user interface.

## **8\. OneTwo:** [https://github.com/google-deepmind/onetwo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/onetwo)

OneTwo is a Python library designed to simplify interactions with large (language and multimodal) foundation models, **primarily aimed at researchers in _prompting_ and _prompting strategies_**.

Some properties of OneTwo that are particularly impactful for researcher productivity include the following:

- **Model-agnostic:** Provides a uniform API to access different models that can easily be swapped and compared.
- **Flexible:** Supports implementation of arbitrarily complex computation graphs involving combinations of sequential and parallel operations, including interleaving of calls to foundation models and to other tools.
- **Efficient:** Automatically optimizes request batching and other details of model server interactions under-the-hood for maximizing throughput, while allowing prompting strategies to be implemented straightforwardly, as if they were dealing with just single requests.
- **Reproducible:** Automatically caches requests/replies for easy stop-and-go or replay of experiments.

Text: At Google Cloud, we recognize that building great products for your customers isn't just about writing and shipping code. It's the messy whiteboard sessions, the hallway conversations and email threads, deciding what to build and how. And after you launch, making sure your application is resilient, secure, and has a meaningful impact on your customers.

It's been a fast-moving year for generative AI. With so many tools hitting the market, you might be asking whether all these new things can actually be useful in real life. After all, people — not machines — are at the heart of great software.

With that in mind, let's walk through a day in the life of a Google Cloud developer using Google AI assistance to get from idea to production.

Imagine that I'm a software engineer at **Cymbal Superstore,** a grocery retailer.

Our website runs on Google Cloud, and I've been tasked to add a _new products page_ showcasing the latest snacks. It's 9AM on Monday, I've got my coffee — let's do this.

## **Design together**

The feature request has landed in my inbox. I use [Gmail's **help me write** feature](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/13384326) to quickly respond.

Then, I hop into a meeting room with my teammate, and we start brainstorming the implementation on a whiteboard.

Now I'm ready to write a design doc. My teammate has to run to a meeting, but I want to bounce around some questions about our architecture. I open [**Bard**](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwj5nMSW-7uBAxWv_-MHHVT7B4gYABAAGgJ5bQ&gclid=Cj0KCQjw06-oBhC6ARIsAGuzdw2pg4RmnA5FMtWozWVY9m4NLx_cLMqc31VUiUOsbrjHEKP00YLJSBgaArGdEALw_wcB&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbOD2p6pW8zJhpprHArh89n65XzGRfuTLXXWbG-Zwe-gYuGP9Gby8Y3y9HqKC3pX8DPpj28Hp7pUiNDpy6awLQ1j1UAoQqMktrdyfwPojwNrde5CEAVWQktXc6kUWoif4GrO8gxXEyu1PWUTH0A&sig=AOD64_3YDWSfYeVmYKOcNtj1DfY_qXHZNg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjz47mW-7uBAxULk4kEHXekAGYQ0Qx6BAgIEAE), and [use **Google Lens**](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-new-features-update-july-2023/) to upload my architecture diagram. Bard reads my architecture diagram, and I have a quick chat with Bard about any potential risks with my proposed implementation.

From there, I export my Bard conversation to Google Docs to start the design doc. I use [Google Docs **Help me write**](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13623623#zippy=%2Cget-started-writing-with-duet-ai-in-google-docs) to generate an outline. This time-saving feature lets me focus on the tricky design questions, like how we might cache [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore) queries on the backend.

By midday, I've sent my design doc to my team for review. Meanwhile, the UX team has been working on a frontend mock for the New Products page.

By the time my design doc is approved, I have a frontend page ready to start testing against. Let's get coding.

## **Code (with help)**

Writing code can be a solitary thing. And although I'm a seasoned TypeScript engineer, I'm fairly new to Google Cloud, and I often find myself with fifty tabs open — documentation, StackOverflow, calming music — just to write 10 lines of code. Let's explore how [Duet AI for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/duet-ai-in-google-cloud-preview) can help me out.

I launch my development environment from [Google Cloud Workstations](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/overview) and open a code editor. First, I use [**Duet AI in Apigee**](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/introducing-duet-ai-in-apigee-api-management-and-application-integration) to auto-generate an OpenAPI spec for the new REST API endpoint. Then, I use a [swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-typescript-api) generator to auto-create TypeScript stub code from that spec.

Now I'm ready to implement the business logic. I use [Duet AI's **code generation**](https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai/docs/create-app-duet-ai#modify-app) to prompt, via code comment, the Firestore query I want. I press _tab_ to accept Duet AI's code suggestions.

Then, I test my code locally — uh oh. I see an error.

I'm not sure what the error means, so I open [**Duet AI chat**](https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai/docs/create-app-duet-ai#run-app-locally) from within my IDE. Duet AI is trained on Google Cloud documentation and sample code, and can help me figure out not only what the error means, but how to fix it in my code — no frantic Googling required.

Once I fix the error, I can use the same Duet AI chat thread to help me write a **test case** for the new endpoint. Duet AI can tailor its response using the contents of my open test file, generating a test that uses the same framework and format as my other tests.

With Duet AI's help, I can get to a working prototype faster because it requires less context-switching out of the IDE.

## **Operate with confidence**

I commit my code to source control, then work through a code review with my teammate. I merge in the new feature, and the New Products page rolls out to production. Hooray. But the software development lifecycle doesn't end here.

As an app developer who will be on-call for this production service, the first thing I want to find are the service logs. I use Duet AI's **console chat** feature to help me navigate the Cloud Run console.

Then, I work with the SRE team to create some [service-level objectives](https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/) for the Inventory service. In Cloud Monitoring. I use Duet AI's **help me modify** feature to create complex queries on my service health. As a non-expert in [PromQL](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/promql), this feature can save me a ton of time looking up [the right syntax.](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)

What about security? Let's say that last week during a debugging session, I granted my teammate a temporary, permissive IAM role in my Google Cloud project. [Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center) can pick up on this. With Duet AI's [AI-generated summaries,](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-security-command-center-overview#ai-summaries) I can quickly understand the issue, and work with the security team to remediate.

## **Share the impact**

A week goes by, and the product lead has asked me to present a few slides at the upcoming all hands. I work with my business analyst colleague to prepare. We want to understand the impact of creating a new products showcase — did those new products sell better after being featured on their own dedicated page?

We start by creating a to-do list in **Google Sheets**, using the [**help me organize**](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13676332) feature.

Then, we dive into the sales data, using Duet AI in [Spanner's](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) **SQL code completion** feature to query the raw transactions data from the last few weeks.

We gather more data from the sales rollup tables in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). As the business analyst writes SQL queries with expert ease, I use Duet's [**code explanation**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-sql-duet-ai#explain_a_sql_query) feature to better understand the data we're gathering.

From there, I jump to Google Slides and use Duet AI's ["Help me visualize"](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13951829?hl=en) tool to generate supporting imagery for the impact report.
