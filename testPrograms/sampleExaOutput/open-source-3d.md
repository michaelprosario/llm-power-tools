**Introduction**

In this article, we will explore the fascinating world of 3D modeling. We will discuss its evolution over time and take a glimpse into what the future holds for this rapidly advancing technology. At a glance, we will learn the following.

## **1.0 What is 3D Modeling**

**1.1 Definition:**

3D stands for three-dimensional. It means something that has height, width, and depth. If you delve into the origin of the term “Modeling”, it stems from Latin “Modulus”. This term was once used to denote a building plan in the 16th century. However, now, the word “Modeling” has a much wider meaning. 3D Modeling is the process of making things that you can measure all three dimensions of and move around or orbit around.

**In one sentence, 3D modeling is a technique used in computer graphics to create digital representations of objects or surfaces.**

**1.2 Description:**

3D modeling is a fascinating technique used in computer graphics that allows for the creation of a three-dimensional digital representation of any object or surface. This process is carried out using specialized software, where an artist manipulates points in virtual space. These points are known as [vertices](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/structure.html) where 3D coordinates (x, y, z) connect the edges of the model in a 3d space.

The collection of these vertices forms what is known as a mesh. This mesh is essentially the skeleton of the 3D model, providing its shape and structure. The more detailed the mesh, the more detailed and realistic the final 3D model will be.

Once the basic shape of the 3D model is created, the next step is often to add textures. [Texturing](https://helpx.adobe.com/beta/fuse/help/3d-visual-dictionary.html) involves applying a ‘skin’ over the mesh of the model.

Text: I am very excited to share that this month we are launching Blender Essentials taught by 3D designer Robin Ruud. Pre-register for the course here and be among the first to hear when it launches. In this post, we will explore what Blender is, which are its main features, why it is the first choice for millions of users worldwide and how it compares with other tools like Cinema 4D, 3ds, and more!  When you become a BYOL member, you gain access to this new Blender course as well as my 30+ additional courses on Photoshop, Lightroom, InDesign, Figma, and more. As a BYOL member you will also enjoy personalized support, earn certificates, and tackle exciting community challenges. Head here to sign-up! What is Blender? Blender is hardly a new arrival to the 3D industry. It was founded in 1994, made available to the public in 1998, and finally presented as open source in 2002, after a successful crowdfunding campaign. Blender is a free 3D graphics suite, designed to run on Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, and used for creating 3D models, animation, video games, and even visual effects for the movie industry. The list goes on and on! I'm sure you've heard of the Oscar-winning animation film "Flow". Blender! Isn't that amazing? Thanks to its built-in features and powerful add-ons, it was possible to take this incredible story to the Academy Awards stage! Ah, I can almost see you dreaming out loud, now! Who could tell that a free, open source, software could rival - and beat - some industry heavy hitters? Hey, but that's not all! There are other awesome projects that used Blender as an active tool across the development stages, also known in the industry as 3D pipeline: Spider-Man: No Way Home (film) – Concept design and pre-visualization. Prey – (film) Visual Effects and environment design. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (videogame) – Asset modelling. Cyberpunk 2077 (videogame) – Asset development. The Man in the High Castle (TV show) – Visual Effects Here’s the good news: You can download, install, and start using this software right now, without having to subscribe to a monthly plan or paying a one-time fee. If you are not familiar with the term, "open source" means that the software is publicly available. Fixes, improvements, and updates are developed by members of the Blender community, in a collaborative spirit that benefits all. Cool, huh? This means that you can now access Blender and explore its huge potential and features, no matter if you are a beginner to the world of 3D graphics or an experienced professional, using the software to learn, upgrade your business and reach new markets, or simply have fun creating 3D print models for a hobby!  Awesome! Why use Blender? Blender is an amazing three-dimensional graphics suite, used by artists and designers, animators and film studios, game developers, and even engineers and scientists, because it allows you to work across the entire 3D pipeline -- or workflow stages of 3D design. Feeling a bit overwhelmed? We're here for you! Let's begin by having a quick look at the most common features available in Blender. There’s much much to do in Blender! Best strategy is exploring each feature, step-by-step. 3D modelling – Allows creating new objects from basic shapes like cubes, spheres, or cylinders, cutting, stretching, and reshaping them into more complex objects. Think about building blocks or Adobe Illustrator’s Shape Builder tool but set in a three-dimensional world interface. Texturing and Shading – The next steps after 3D modelling, we can add texture, detail, or lighting effects, bringing realism to the designed 3D objects. Rigging and Animation – Think about animating a 3D character, making it walk, run, or sit down. Rigging adds a structure, a skeleton and joints to support the 3D model, allowing for setting poses and movement. Rendering – Converts the 3D model into a finished image or video, with high-quality shapes and textures, lighting, shadows, and reflections. Visual Effects (Compositing) and Video Editing – Now let’s think of a Hollywood blockbuster! Compositing is all about replacing a green screen background into a completely new landscape or environment and adding visual effects and CGI (computer generated imagery) to real-life footage. Video editors arrange, cut, trim, and edit the footage into a final visual product, like a movie or a documentary. This is how detailed we can get in Blender, from basic character sculpting to finished render. It sounds like a lot, I know, and when you look at all the interface options, menus, and panels it's perfectly fine to feel a bit intimidated, but that's all normal! If you learn consistently and practice your skills, it will all start flowing smoothly and be fun! Next question! Is Blender a smart choice for Beginners? Blender is, for sure, a smart choice for everyone who wants to start learning and designing 3D graphics. It's free, available across multiple operating systems, and covers the relevant stages of 3D design and animation. Keep in mind, of course, that there is a learning curve to Blender. First, you must realign your mindset with a new three-dimensional workspace (X, Y, and Z axes will become your new best friends). Blender's all-in-one superpower also means that it takes time to get used to a complex user interface, to a considerable range of menus, tools, and shortcuts that require a step-by-step approach in the first days and weeks. As you learn and practice, things get easier and more comfortable, but it's important to accept that it takes time to get there. Don't begin by producing your own animated movie! To help users across this learning curve, Blender benefits from a vast array of documentation, tutorials, courses, online groups and forums, in one of the largest communities in the 3D design industry. 3D modelling is like sculpting in stone or shaping clay, with the perk of seeing the artwork come to life! Does Blender run on any computer? Even though Blender is a bit lighter on computer resources than some of its competitors, 3D modelling and rendering is always demanding, so there are recommended software and hardware requirements for each operating system. Verify these requirements to ensure that the software will run smoothly and prevent crashes and frustration. The software download on Blender's website, for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Installing it on your computer is quick and easy, it will only take a few minutes! I have a feeling we will see a lot more of this nice monkey! Blender add-ons If you are not entirely new to the design adventure, I'm sure you have heard terms like plug-ins and add-ons. These are additional tools, usually developed by third-party companies, that enhance a software's built-in features and help streamline your work, so you can be the first at the finish line in a very competitive market. Blender is not an exception for this, and you can count on a huge and growing collection of add-ons and resources that will speed things up and brighten up your work, keeping your mind less worried about deadlines and more focused on creativity! Some of them are also free, others have a price tag on them, so take some time to learn what they do and if they fit your project's budget. Let's scroll through some of these gems, just for you to know that no matter how complicated a project may seem, there is always an add-on to take you above and beyond.   Modeling and Sculpting Sculpt Toolkit – Free – This add-on speeds up organic sculpting (awesome for characters and creatures), improves user interface settings, and makes mask creating and mesh extraction easier. HardOps &amp; Boxcutter – Paid - Used by 3D modelers, game artists, and concept designers, HardOps delivers a toolkit that will make modelling a lot more dynamic and safer. BoxCutter allows for fast and precise shape cutting into 3D models.    Texturing and Shading Node Wrangler – free and built-in – Saves tons of time when working with materials by speeding up shade editing and providing shortcuts for quick linking, previewing textures, and managing shader nodes. TexTools – Free – Used by game developers, texture artists, and asset creators, TexTools improves UV mapping, baking, and texturing tools in Blender.  Rendering and Lighting Easy HDRI – Free – Simplifies HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging) by allowing for only-click setup for lighting settings, for realistic lighting effects in 3D scenes. K-Cycles – Paid – Used by architects, animators, and visual effects professionals, speeds up to 2x rendering, denoising, and caustics processes, in certain scenarios.  Animations and Rigging Animation Nodes – Free – Similar to Blender’s Geometry Nodes, but more focused on motion and effects, allows for complex motion graphics and procedural animations that include object animation, particles, and deformation. Auto-rig Pro – Paid – Allows for the automatic rigging of characters, creatures, and mechanical objects, saving hours of manual work in character design. Supports game engines like Unity and Unreal. Wow, look at all the detail and the structure that supports the 3D model! How awesome is this? Blender vs Competition Can a free tool match premium competitors and industry standards? Let’s see how Blender behaves in a side-by-side competition with other 3D design apps, based on a set of core features that may support you on how you plan your full journey from a first 3D cube with a light fixture to a Hollywood Oscar Winning production! These are only some of Blender's competitors, but I believe this selection casts good light on how Blender can be a smart first choice to start mastering the Essentials of 3D design and how you can, soon, pick a specific field to become a specialist. Let's finish with a quick recap! Blender – Strengths and weaknesses If you are considering stepping into the world of 3D design (and I know you are!), it makes sense that you understand why Blender can be the right choice of software for you as well as its limitations. Pros Value – Blender is free for personal and commercial use. There are no plans or licenses surrounding its core functionality. All-in-One – Blender is a do-it-all solution, you can tackle a complex 3D project from early modelling to rendering or video compositing inside one single piece of software. Did I mention it’s also free? Updates and Support – For Blender, open source means there are frequent updates that fix bugs, improve its features and performance. Support from an expanding community and a wide array of learning resources add a layer of confidence in a software with a considerable learning curve. And it’s free! Lightweight and Versatile – Blender is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux and runs well without you having to invest in top notch hardware, like some of its competitors. For free! Add-on Collections – There is a huge library of free (and paid) add-ons for Blender that bring additional resources, assist on its limited collaboration features, and save valuable workflow time. Well, many of these are free! Sign up to the Course, this Pop Art masterpiece is expecting you! Cons Learning Curve – Even if balanced with strong learning resources and community support, it is true that Blender’s unique interface, shortcut-based workflow, and the need for a certain level of previous technical knowledge to tackle tasks like animation rigging, makes it a bit harder for beginners and gets easier with time and practice. Freelance and Indie Power Tool – Blender is growing fast worldwide and is continuously evolving because of its open source side, but it is still not an industry standard. This is particularly felt in the major Film and Video Game producers and developers. Limited Collaboration – Blender doesn’t have built-in and real-time collaboration tools, some manual linking or third-party add-ons are required to compensate for this limitation. Performance and Stability Issues – Projects with complex meshes and high detail can be heavy on computer resources, when compared to some competitors that are more focused on specific steps in the pipeline. It’s a work in progress – Some features like character animation or sculpting still need further development, but again, its open source policy brings constant updates and improvements.

When Disney’s Toy Story debuted in 1995, it was the first movie I watched that was 3D. Now, reminiscing about that movie, I was instantly wowed by the imagery, thinking it looked so real. This experience influenced my perception of art, and as a kid, I thought, “I want to create a 3D movie when I grow up.” Where I am going with this is that over a few years, even up to me writing this blog, I have explored many different hobbies and one of those hobbies included using tools like [3D modeling software](https://www.g2.com/categories/3d-modeling).

After exploring and revisiting these tools recently, I encountered a few challenges with some of these applications, including steep learning curves, high computer demands, and other issues with some of the features or functionalities. With so many options popping up, and with some of those options coming with an expensive price tag, it can be tough to find the right 3D modeling software truly worth your time.Whether you are a product designer, educator, animator, game designer, or even someone looking for a new hobby, there are 3D modeling tools for everyone.That’s why I’ve put together this list. As someone with experience and time dedicated to these applications, I’ve rounded up the best 3D modeling software of 2025. I’ve generated this list based on a few factors: budget, complexity, compatibility issues, and unique features that each application has to offer.

## 10 best 3D modeling software that I reviewed (and liked)

If I had to explain what 3D modeling software was in an “elevator pitch”, I would describe 3D modeling software as a computer program that transforms your ideas or designs into three-dimensional forms, or 3D. The resulting 3D models can be used by many to visualize a product, an object, a person, a character, simulations, and anything you can think of that you would like to communicate to others visually. For me, 3D modeling software plays a crucial role in visualization and design communication. Instead of archaic blueprints and wasted paper to illustrate a point, 3D modeling can show us details of an object from different angles. We no longer need to build the final prototype to see the functionality in real-time. I also love that with 3D modeling software becoming an evolving tool, many applications offer team collaboration features and integrations with other apps to enhance workflow.

#### How did I find and evaluate the best 3D modeling apps?

When putting together this list, I drew on my journey of testing 3D modeling tools over several years and my current experience, re-testing the tools again this year. In addition, I also collaborated with professionals and did extensive research, gathering honest feedback on what others have experienced using these products.

I explored which tools excelled at certain projects, where they fell short, and whether I felt they were worth your time and investment. Using [G2](https://www.g2.com/) Grid Reports and product reviews, I leveraged artificial intelligence to analyze real users’ wants, needs, and pain points for each tool.

In cases where I couldn’t personally test a tool due to limited access, I consulted a professional with hands-on experience and validated their insights using verified G2 reviews. The screenshots featured in this article may be a mix of those captured during testing and ones obtained from the vendor’s G2 page.

### What factors do I think make the best 3d modeling software worth it

3D modeling has seen significant growth over the past few years, and because of this, the software market is saturated with various 3D modeling programs to choose from. Choosing the right 3D modeling software depends on a variety of factors. Here are the factors I paid attention to when choosing the best 3D modeling tool for me:

- **Ease of Use:** In my experience, choosing the best 3D modeling software starts with determining your skill level. These tools have a lot of features and before you can dive right into using one of these tools, you need to determine how much time you want to dedicate to learning an application.
- **Budget:** Budget has always been on my mind, especially in this economy. I’m always trying to save where I can. That’s why I must factor in how much I am willing to spend on a 3D modeling tool. Do I want to commit to a monthly subscription or pay an annual fee? If you have budget limitations, trying an open-source or [free 3D modeling software](https://learn.g2.com/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybi5nMi5jb20vMTAtYmVzdC1mcmVlLTNkLW1vZGVsaW5nLXNvZnR3YXJl&ct=SEARCH&pid=4099946&cid=112697286062&t=M2QgbW9kZWxpbmc%3D&d=learn.g2.com&c=2&c=3&c=6&rp=1&ab=false&opcid=&rs=UNKNOWN&hs-expires=1768519090&hs-version=1&hs-signature=APUk-v4U-ybttJ0fs-VEMC76UEbFpvg3oQ&hsLang=en) might be better for you.
- **Feature and App Compatibility:** The features an application offers make a huge difference in how effective that app is going to be for my projects. If my goal is to create [3D-printed](https://learn.g2.com/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybi5nMi5jb20vZnJlZS0zZC1wcmludGluZy1zb2Z0d2FyZQ%3D%3D&ct=SEARCH&pid=4099946&cid=10356706509&t=M2QgbW9kZWxpbmc%3D&d=learn.g2.com&c=2&c=3&c=6&rp=5&ab=false&opcid=&rs=UNKNOWN&hs-expires=1768519090&hs-version=1&hs-signature=APUk-v5KCGm_4bHMvlIvnrIs2A5HjnNhbA&hsLang=en) models, then using an application that integrates with a 3D printer is necessary. Depending on my project needs, it is one of the biggest decision-making factors in choosing the best software.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** It’s important when choosing a 3D modeling software, that it be compatible with your device. Whether it be a Mac, PC, or a mobile device. It is important to make sure your device runs applications without overheating or crashing. That’s why I always check the minimum hardware specs needed for a 3D modeling tool, since they can be pretty impressive applications.
- **Collaboration and Team Workflow:** Another important factor that I would consider is the app’s ability to collaborate with others. Some of your projects might be a group project, which means different people might be working off the same file. Real-time tools or cloud-based capabilities might help enhance workflow across teams.
- **Community Support:**  Finding an application that has a strong community and good support system makes a huge difference, especially when you are stuck on an issue. In addition, when there is a large community that uses the same tool, there are generally tutorials and resources you can find that others have created to help you learn new tricks or solve problems along the way.

By considering these factors, I’ve been able to choose the best 3D modeling software that works for me. I’ve tested more than 15 3D modeling platforms that fit my criteria. Of the 15 I tested, these are the top 10 3D modeling products that stood out for their functionality, compatibility, features, performance, and community support.The list below contains genuine user feedback from the 3D modeling software category. It’s important to note that in the context of this list, vendors offering a free trial are also considered free.

To be included in this category, a product must:

- Provide tools for constructing and modifying 3D graphic models
- Allow users to store and export completed models
- Not be specifically created for building design and architecture, civil engineering design, or CAD

## 1\. Sketchup: Best for simple architectural modeling

[SketchUp](https://www.g2.com/products/sketchup/reviews) (formerly Google SketchUp) is a premiere 3D modeling software that is used to create and edit 3D models with the “Push and Pull” method. This method allows designers to take a flat surface and mold it into a 3D form. I’ve seen many projects created in SketchUp, such as interior design stages, video game design, and architecture. Ranked as a Leader on the G2 3D Modeling Software Grid, SketchUp remains a top choice for fast, accessible architectural modeling.

As of 2025, SketchUp holds a [24.96% market share](https://6sense.com/tech/3d-modeling/sketchup-market-share) in the 3D modeling tools segment, with over 3,659 companies using it.

![sketchup](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd36WAjroI2UxJGiT00Avlqz7wLwKvzbmLjfnoM6Z05QRiPcPWf25qCcquXVv2n9UuisClFpIrrPwNYvp6HlFb9pykBxRNs41wBTtwhHVLd4fBxZMJV5dcC6PQCGO9V9cKF2Eeq?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Recently, I started using the SketchUp Free subscription, which is their web-based version that offers limited features. However, I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about software that I might not have considered otherwise, without a budget penalty.There are a few reasons I put SketchUp on this list. SketchUp is one of the few 3D modeling programs that offers an intuitive interface and therefore a minimal learning curve, making it a favorite among beginners or professionals looking for quick results. There is also a wide library of extensions and plugins that you can use to improve your models, including the 3D Warehouse (SketchUp Warehouse), which offers a bunch of pre-made 3D models that you can experiment with or add to your models. Lastly, the platform integrates with a variety of other platforms, such as AutoCAD, Revit, and rendering engines like V-Ray. I’ve also seen it integrate with Google Earth, which is pretty neat!

While I found SketchUp incredibly easy to learn and helpful for quickly drafting architectural concepts, I noticed that it's not really built for more advanced modeling workflows. For example, when I wanted to explore sculpting or parametric design, I had to look elsewhere. Based on G2 user feedback, this is a fairly common limitation. Many users mention SketchUp’s simplicity as both a strength and a constraint, depending on the complexity of your project.

The rendering capabilities also lean more toward functional than photorealistic. If you’re aiming to produce lifelike visuals directly within the software, you may find yourself turning to third-party tools. G2 customer reviews mention using additional rendering plug-ins to bridge this gap.

As someone dabbling in animation, I also noticed SketchUp isn't really geared toward that use case. It's best suited for static models or layout visualization. According to Verified reviews on G2, animation support isn’t a major focus here, and that’s something to keep in mind if you're looking for an all-in-one tool for modeling and animation.

Lastly, while I appreciate the streamlined interface, pricing can be a consideration depending on the features you need.

#### **What I like about SketchUp:**

- With SketchUp’s “Push and Pull” method, this 3D modeling app is created for beginners just starting out, like me, when I first started using this software. The method is incredibly intuitive, allowing me to transform flat surfaces into 3D forms with a few clicks.
- I also love how SketchUp offers a rich, vast library of extensions I can add to enhance my 3D models, as well as a 3D warehouse with pre-built models that I can add to my project.

#### **What do G2 users like about SketchUp:**

“Sketchup is a pretty intuitive program to learn from the moment you start. I like all of the free plug-ins and the support videos. Layout is a great extension as well, just wish it was a little easier to use for some things.”

\- [SketchUp Review](https://www.g2.com/products/sketchup/reviews/sketchup-review-5354405), Brian P.

#### **What I dislike about SketchUp:**

- I felt that despite the many features SketchUp had, it was lacking in creating complex forms because it didn’t have as well-equipped features as some other 3D modeling software I have used— like parametric design, sculpting, and photorealistic rendering.
- Another dislike that I have for the app, is its limitation on export files. This is especially true for the free version. These are just some of the files I was unable to export: .stp, .iges, .fbx.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about SketchUp:**

“While SketchUp excels in many areas, there are a few drawbacks, especially when it comes to 3D printing. The software isn’t specifically designed for creating models intended for 3D printing, which can lead to issues like non-manifold geometry, overlapping faces, or gaps in the model. These issues often require additional time for troubleshooting and fixing before a model is ready for printing. Additionally, the precision tools in SketchUp, while sufficient for many design tasks, can sometimes feel limiting when exact measurements and tolerances are critical for 3D printing. This can result in models that don’t print as intended without further refinement in more specialized 3D printing software.”- [SketchUp Review](https://www.g2.com/products/sketchup/reviews/sketchup-review-10032925), Loi T.

## 2\. Blender: Best for open-source 3D creation suite

[Blender](https://www.g2.com/products/blender/reviews) is an open-source 3D modeling software that allows users to create 3D models, animations, and visual effects. Blender is a free software and one of the few fully accessible 3D software that you can share or use without limitations. Top-rated Blender alternatives on G2 include Unity, Cinema 4D, and 3ds Max Design—each offering distinct strengths in animation, motion graphics, and architectural modeling.

I’ve been using Blender since high school when the Blender 2.69 version was out. The latest and last version I used before I decided on a career switch was Blender 4.0, but it’s amazing to see that Blender keeps updating periodically. It is now, as of writing this article, at Blender 4.3. With this update, I started dabbling into again. That’s one of the reasons I love this application —despite the platform maintaining its free version, it has a loyal fanbase. It’s clear the developers listen to their community and work hard to keep evolving the software.

![Blender](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXesjY9WnE24apWlEd3pzaQiatoO3Lf3NKWYfX6j216IngMyv0MMqdxE5dugcBKuakfsOUcsxMDsOb_4_0BkKX25sP7WO3fxBEyXPzujzmfLuZUdPBOcfQCRD36r17paWWmTPUSDMw?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Other than the fact that Blender is one of the most robust applications that remains free to its users, because of the massive support there are a ton of learning tools and resources that I have found over the years that helped me dive even deeper into this application.In addition to these factors, I also love Blender’s powerful render engines, Eevee and Cycles (what cute names). Both of these render engines offer real-time rendering and photorealistic results, which cater to a variety of projects and complex workflows. Blender also offers cross-platform compatibility, which means the app can work on different operating systems like macOS, Windows, and Linux.

From modeling and sculpting to animation and compositing, it’s incredibly full-featured—especially for an open-source platform. That said, getting the hang of it did take some time. The interface can feel dense at first, and based on G2 community feedback, I’m not alone—many new users mention needing a few weeks to feel fully comfortable with its layout and workflow. Still, once the basics click, it becomes second nature.

One area where I think Blender has room to grow is its level of integration with mainstream industry pipelines. Since it’s not a proprietary tool, it’s not always aligned with the software stacks used in studios or large-scale production environments. Verified reviews on G2 echo this—while they love Blender’s capabilities, they point out that it's not yet the standard in industries that rely heavily on tools like Maya or 3ds Max.

That said, for indie creators, students, or anyone looking for a highly flexible platform without the high price tag, Blender remains a top choice. Its open-source nature continues to attract a thriving, supportive community that contributes plugins and updates regularly, which is something I really appreciate.

#### **What I like about Blender:**

- Even though Blender has quite the learning curve, I love how powerful the platform is with its vast toolset for modeling, texturing, animation, video editing, and lighting.
- I love how extensive the rendering engines are and the options that these engines provide when exporting your project. Both Eevee and Cycles offer a lot of variety that you can integrate with projects.
- With how supportive Blender is, I was able to find many resources at my disposal to use to get to know more about techniques the application can provide for me.

#### **What do G2 users like about Blender:**

“I am a big fan of Blender, a 3D software that is both free and open-source. It impresses me with its high-quality tools that are usually found in expensive commercial software. Blender includes features commonly used in the industry, such as modeling, animation, simulation, and rendering which I found super helpful.”

\- [Blender Review](https://www.g2.com/products/blender/reviews/blender-review-9555162), Vaibhav S.

#### **What I dislike about Blender:**

- Despite Blender having a massive community, there is no dedicated customer support. Blender relies on community forums and discussions to help users who may come across an issue. So it was a bit of a “head-scratcher”  for me when I came across technical issues.
- I had a hard time working with the simulation feature’s performance. Since smoke or fluid simulations are complex, they can be intensive on your computer and cause performance lag.

**What do G2 users dislike about Blender:**
“Importing large FBX files is very slow! Although I have a powerful machine (32GB RAM, i7, Nvidia GF 1070) sometimes I wait for more than 10 minutes to import a large FBX file (>1 GB).”

\- [Blender Review](https://www.g2.com/products/blender/reviews/blender-review-8420347), Ziya M.

## 3\. Maya: Best for high-end 3D modeling and animation

[Maya](https://www.g2.com/products/maya/reviews) is an Autodesk 3D modeling software that can be used all-in-one for 3D creations, animation, film, and more. Maya is an industry-standard 3D software application and has been used frequently in the film and animation industry, as well as the gaming industry.

![Maya](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXekK9mrpwxVXuhVOG8Xi2p72coNXGzdQta6vU3cVGZHIS1VCI-PWs17BNshJC6qjskUc6KHbxIW9-b4FaFedYf5dO08BafWJUY0dOlxJTLxCFqqFjVaeHEWvQRtXD_pFZq3YqYf?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

I had the good fortune of being able to use Maya for free since it was offered to students when I took a 3D modeling course. Maya does have an extensive price tag that comes with it, so to justify that price tag Maya offers a lot of fitting features which I greatly enjoyed when exploring this tool.

The reason Maya is so unmatched in most industries is that the app can handle many complex modeling and animation projects, including facial rigs and motion paths. Maya’s polygon and NURBS functionalities, combined with the advanced UV mapping tools, make it an ideal tool for creating realistic models. I also enjoyed Maya’s built-in physics and simulation tools, like Bifrost for fluids and nCloth for cloth dynamics.

Maya continues to impress me with its high-end animation and modeling capabilities, especially when it comes to character rigging and complex simulations. It’s a staple in many professional pipelines, and for good reason. The precision and level of control it offers are exceptional. According to G2 sentiment analysis, Maya’s toolkit is one of the most advanced in the industry, particularly for film and game production.

While I had no trouble navigating its interface, the performance across platforms did vary in my experience. On macOS, it ran smoothly, but when working from my Windows machine at home, the application would sometimes crash mid-project. I found myself frequently saving backups just to avoid losing progress. According to G2 review data, this isn’t uncommon; some users have also mentioned system compatibility as something to watch for, depending on hardware specs and OS.

Another thing worth noting is Maya’s reliance on external plugins. While the core features are robust, there were certain effects I needed that required third-party tools—many of which came at an extra cost. Several G2 users point out the same: while Maya is incredibly capable, achieving its full potential often involves supplementing with paid plugins.

Even with that, I continue to use Maya for projects that demand precision and depth. It’s a tool that grows with you, especially once you know how to tailor it to your workflow.

#### **What I like about Maya:**

- I like Maya’s advanced features and its ability to handle intricate modeling and animation tasks. I found the software particularly useful when creating realistic characters and textures.
- I love that Maya had powerful simulation tools like Bifrost and nCloth, which made environment modeling all the more lifelike.

#### **What do G2 users like about Maya:**

“Best about maya is ease of 3d modeling. With just shift alt and ctrl + mouse buttons you can rule the modeling. Its so easy and fast once you understand the basic. Features like fx and arnold renderer is cherry on the top. Customer support is also too good. If you face any bug or issue with installation the support given is amazing.”

\- [Maya Review](https://www.g2.com/products/maya/reviews/maya-review-9883245), Abhishek S.

#### **What I dislike about Maya:**

- Although the Mac I used in class could handle Maya, working on that same project on my Windows setup at home caused frequent crashes. To not lose progress, I had to back up my work on my external hard drive, which disrupted my workflow and caused a lot of stress.
- I did not like that some projects required me to use a multitude of plugins, which unfortunately some were not free. This drove up my expenses using this app.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Maya:**

“I don't like that some simple operations may turn off or crash, its architecture is already old, unfortunately, but it is still my favorite tool, the customer support sucks.”- [Maya Review](https://www.g2.com/products/maya/reviews/maya-review-9883245), Jorge R.

## 4\. Unity: Best for real-time 3D animation and game development

[Unity](https://www.g2.com/products/unity/reviews) is a popular 3D modeling application for creating video games, animation, and VR/AR content. It’s popular among the gaming industry and is commonly used as the industry-standard game development program. Also known as a game engine, Unity offers real-time tools and cross-platform functionality for artists and designers.

![Unity](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcJ12cACnIR-BlaOtacDbdxaMEinroHaCOXPnBhjF3gwJxiP8Q46o_y8f5BFa832TNVkpihYPpwM8KazRod28KfMHOvYzoSyYhFgW-oI1RfwofFxZtvaipttXMLbMPH7yNetZJB?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

There are many positives to this 3D software. Besides Unity’s cross-platform capabilities, which make it the most versatile engine available, it also has a large asset store of pre-built assets, scripts, tools, and plugins that you can choose from. It was a lifesaver for me when I was looking for certain functionalities I wanted to have for my character’s obstacle course. Another aspect that I love about Unity is that it can integrate with a lot of other software, including Blender, Maya, and Photoshop. Unity is also known for its real-time capabilities. This includes the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) that allowed me to create stunning scenes without compromising my computer’s performance.

Unity has been a go-to platform for me when working on interactive and real-time 3D projects. The engine’s flexibility is unmatched, especially if you're building cross-platform experiences for games, AR/VR, or simulations. What I appreciate most is how accessible it is for developers of all levels—something that many reviewers on G2 have also highlighted. Its large asset store, vast learning ecosystem, and broad device support make it easy to build and iterate quickly.

That said, I’ve noticed that the frequency of updates can sometimes create friction in workflows. In a few cases, I ran into compatibility issues or had to adjust to changes in the API, which made it harder to follow along with existing tutorials or community guides. It’s something verified G2 users bring up fairly often—while Unity’s evolving nature is a strength, it can also be a challenge when it comes to keeping up with version-specific changes.

I also hoped for more out of its visual scripting tools. While Unity Visual Scripting (formerly Bolt) is a welcome addition, it doesn’t yet match the depth or intuitiveness of visual systems in other engines like Unreal’s Blueprints. Insights from G2 reviewers point out that while scripting is accessible, users still lean on code or third-party plugins for more advanced workflows.

Still, Unity continues to be one of the most developer-friendly and scalable tools out there. The ability to bring ideas to life across platforms is what keeps me coming back to it.

#### **What I like about Unity:**

- Normally, the complexity of software is associated with the level of learning you need to know about the app, but I love that Unity offers a lot of tools to turn your 3D models into near-realistic objects.
- I believe Unity has one of the largest and most active communities in the 3D modeling space, which means I have access to a lot of tools and resources that I can use to familiarize myself with the app.

#### **What do G2 users like about Unity:**

“Easy to learn and use, it is excellent for beginners who want to enter the world of video game creation. It offers a multitude of features that guide you through all aspects of game development, including 3D, 2D, lighting, coding, animation, UI, optimization, and more.”

\- [Unity Review](https://www.g2.com/products/unity/reviews/unity-review-1424820), Ernesto S.

#### **What I dislike about Unity:**

- While Unity’s UI system is functional, to me it often feels clunky, especially when some projects require 3rd party plugins to have my models achieve certain results that the original system could not provide.
- After using Unity’s garbage collection system, I noticed performance hitches or frame drops in some of the projects I worked on, especially with projects that had rapid memory allocation.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Unity:**

“Is very overwhelming at first, not gonna lie. Fortunately, there are many step-by-step videos online that ease you into the motion of things. After that, the only thing you need is to select your preferred path and get to it.”

## 5\. Creo Parametric: Best for precision mechanical design

[Creo Parametric](https://www.g2.com/products/creo-parametric/reviews) is PTC’s 3D CAD (computer-aided design) and 3D modeling software and is mainly used to build 3D product designs. The application is used to design, analyze, and share information about products to make it easier for engineers to streamline the product-to-manufacture process.

![Creo Parametric](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc9Ur5ez2WJgMPW5SDvDN0ojxI6XtBf247ay3MeKaexT5pJbfSLsvK6N9KKLIA5Aeg3rJBdEi-sjc5UModzYQKOl9HYIK6xz7kJQI5LI3m0RYvTw0fZfXj-Pkbj8taLkOhxXbvt?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Over the course of a few weeks, I talked to professionals who have used this product and got their take on its pros and cons. I was also given the chance to explore the interface for a little bit. As you can already guess from its name, Creo Parametric **excels in parametric modeling**, a design method in 3D CAD programs that uses parameters and geometric elements when creating a model. Creo Parametric is known to have a pretty sophisticated algorithm to capture information and parameter predictions.

After speaking with a few engineering professionals, I was informed that the Creo Parametric also offers advanced simulation and analysis tools, including thermal structures and motion simulations. I’ve often seen the results from professionals who frequent this app and use the application to create 3D prints. Creo offers built-in tools for designing models for 3D  printing, which is pretty cool.

When I explored its features, I immediately noticed how much depth it offers in terms of simulation, parametric modeling, and manufacturing integration. This level of functionality is exactly why many G2 users consider it a top choice for enterprise teams and product development workflows.

That said, the interface can feel a bit dense at first. With so many tools and options packed into the UI, it can take time to feel fully comfortable navigating it. I found the onboarding experience to be less intuitive compared to other platforms, and feedback on G2 has also pointed out that Creo’s steep learning curve is something to prepare for—especially for those coming from more lightweight or design-focused modeling tools.

Another thing I noticed was the amount of information required just to request a free trial. Rather than offering an instant download, you need to submit a fair amount of personal and company details to access the software, which can add some friction to getting started. As for the cost, it’s definitely on the higher end. Based on notable patterns on G2, this aligns with Creo’s positioning as an enterprise-grade solution rather than a tool for casual or freelance use.

Still, for teams working on complex assemblies and precision engineering, Creo delivers the kind of accuracy and control that’s hard to find elsewhere.

#### **What I like about Creo Parametric:**

- I liked how advanced Creo’s parametric modeling features looked when I explored the tool. I can see why it’s a popular 3D modeling software for product design.
- One of the coolest features I discovered is Creo’s support for 3D printing. It has a lot of built-in tools to make it easy to design models for additive manufacturing and 3D printing.

#### **What do G2 users like about Creo Parametric:**

“Creo Parametric is best for managing large assembly files. It has various features which are pretty easy to use. It is very flexible and customizable. It has very good technical support which enhances the implementation process.”

- [Creo Parametric Review](https://www.g2.com/products/creo-parametric/reviews/creo-parametric-review-9040023), Pavan T.

#### **What I dislike about Creo Parametric:**

- Maybe it’s because I did not want to become a product designer in my timeline, but navigating the interface was overwhelming for me. There were many tools that I didn’t understand and many names of these tools that I was not familiar with, which made understanding the application difficult.
- Getting access to Creo was a bit of a hassle for me. Even getting the free trial, I had to request it on PTC’s site by putting in a lot of personal information.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Creo Parametric:**

“Its very costly as compare to the other CAD Softwares in the market. Apart from Price pont of view. I dont see any disadvantages of using creo. its mostly suitable for solid and sheetmetal modules. They have to improve more on Plastics side of the module.”- [Creo Parametric Review](https://www.g2.com/products/creo-parametric/reviews/creo-parametric-review-7760334), Akshay B.

## 6\. Coohom: Best for interior design and home layouts

[Coohom](https://www.g2.com/products/coohom/reviews) is your leading 3D modeling design software that allows users to create interior designs and floor plans. This affordable interior design platform comes with a free option that offers basic features, which is a great option for those wanting to learn more about designing floor plans without being dedicated to a subscription.

![Coohom](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcyPtpf_O1c1hsCrS1REtoMhu4kY2E-bujCq8WDoeYbxckyqYFaNcXmdGb26IKTx-K2GSox_Qk_SXCaBQql_qcgLoWk43PE7X7UZupfdvBu6Usis1-9ypvf7PfpuYqI6TqnxQ7L?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

When I was in high school, I briefly thought about becoming an architect before I transitioned my aspirations. However, Coohom was not released until 2018, which makes it one of the newest software on this list. I was excited that Coohom offered a free version for me to try this year.What I loved about Coohom’s interface was its user-friendly interface. It offers a drag-and-drop functionality which makes it easy to create interior designs and 3D layouts for beginners. It’s the perfect tool for anyone looking to create visualizations without extensive 3D modeling knowledge. In conjunction with its drag-and-drop functionality, Coohom provides a vast library of pre-built assets, such as furniture and decor, that you can directly add to your designs. If Sims didn’t awaken your desire for interior design, Coohom certainly will.

Coohom made it incredibly easy for me to visualize interior spaces quickly. The drag-and-drop functionality, extensive asset library, and 4K rendering features are great for creating polished room layouts with minimal effort. I found it especially useful for showcasing concepts to clients, and from what I’ve seen on G2 review data, many users appreciate how Coohom speeds up design presentations without requiring deep 3D modeling expertise.

That said, I did find some limitations when I wanted to go beyond what the templates offered. Like many platforms designed for ease of use, customization can be a bit constrained—particularly when working with pre-built assets. A few other verified reviews on G2 mentioned that while the templates look great, making extensive edits to them isn’t always intuitive or flexible.

Coohom is clearly specialized for interior design, which is its strength—but that also means it’s not the best fit for broader 3D modeling or complex architectural projects. If you're aiming to build detailed structures or explore open-ended modeling workflows, you might need a more expansive tool. That said, for interior-focused workflows, especially in residential or commercial space planning, Coohom delivers a streamlined and visually impressive experience.

#### **What I like about Coohom:**

- I like that Coohom offers real-time rendering and can produce high-quality visuals quickly, which makes it ideal for professionals or any user who needs to polish designs in a time crunch.
- Coohom is very easy to use, which makes it quite a timesaver to learn the application quickly if you are looking for an interior design tool to try.

#### **What do G2 users like about Coohom:**

“One of the best aspects of Coohom is its easy-to-use 3D visualization tool, which makes it simple to create realistic room designs. The drag-and-drop feature allows for quick adjustments, and the extensive library of furniture and decor items adds variety. It’s a great tool for getting professional-looking results without needing advanced design skills.”

\- [Coohom Review](https://www.g2.com/products/coohom/reviews/coohom-review-10436527), Munfar A.

#### **What I dislike about Coohom:**

- Although the application is cloud-based, which makes it great to take my project on the go, this could be a double-edged sword at times if you have an unstable internet connection.
- I’ve noticed there were a lot of limitations with other app integrations and it does not integrate well with other 3D modeling or CAD tools.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Coohom:**

“It should start its integration with Revit. As Coohom still lacks in some of the modeling features but making the model in revit and doing rest of the things like material light and rendering or Revit would be great combo.”- [Coohom Review](https://www.g2.com/products/coohom/reviews/coohom-review-6756060), Laiba W.

## 7\. NVIDIA Omniverse: Best for real-time team collaboration

[NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.g2.com/products/nvidia-omniverse/reviews) is an NVIDIA extension app and modular platform that uses advanced APIs, SDKs, and other microservices to build real-time collaborative 3D models. Basically, rather than the app serving as a 3D modeling tool, its focus is built around it being a central hub for designers, artists, and engineers working together on projects in a shared environment.

![NVIDIA Omniverse](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc72Rhp2dQgsvI3656P90O0WfanfwcPPYm_1Tsi1RkfsDATzNVNNQA6OEDC9dX0aa-AkO3h9EJqfehc5JKqm9c_jTRKRRFQlDhlyo3yzA6PhcioU9klK6AIdsunTig1pp9c4LER?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

If you are working on a team project, this application is a great addition to your skillset as it offers real-time collaboration. One of the biggest reasons I love this tool, other than it offering seamless collaboration, is the app is built on Pixar’s Universal Scene Description (USD) framework, which means the app is quite compatible with a variety of industry-standard tools like Maya, 3DS Max, and Unreal Engine. I also like that Omniverse supports AI tools and features like noise reduction and generative modeling.

The platform makes it possible for multiple creators to work on the same project at once—something I found especially valuable when coordinating complex scenes with teammates. G2 users consistently highlight this collaborative functionality as a major strength, especially for enterprise pipelines involving animation, simulation, and design.

That said, the hardware requirements are something to be aware of. As the name suggests, Omniverse is designed to run best with an NVIDIA GPU. When working on a machine without one, I noticed performance wasn't quite as smooth—particularly during rendering and exporting. G2 sentiment analysis also point out that using non-NVIDIA GPUs can lead to a less optimized experience.

In terms of accessibility, the platform feels very much geared toward large studios or enterprise teams. While it offers robust tools for those environments, the cost and infrastructure needs might not make as much sense for freelancers or smaller creative groups. A number of G2 user reviews state this as well—the value is undeniable, but the entry point may be better suited for larger organizations with the resources to support it.

Even so, for studios prioritizing real-time teamwork and advanced simulation, Omniverse is one of the most forward-thinking platforms available.

#### **What I like about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

- If you plan to work with a team on a project, this cloud-based platform is created to streamline communication and productivity across teams that can work on the same project together. Although a bit of a learning curve, I thought this collaboration app was extremely helpful in keeping a project organized.
- I like that NVIDIA’s RTX technology offers ray tracing and AI features. In addition, I liked that Omniverse offers photorealistic rendering in real-time, which was very intuitive.

#### **What do G2 users like about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

“NVIDIA has leveraged its industry dominance in the GPU world, to create a multi-GPU cloud resident platform, which creates photorealistic visuals and clean and connected workflows. The latest integration with Apple Vision Pro is definitely a plus point.”

\- [NVIDIA Omniverse Review](https://www.g2.com/products/nvidia-omniverse/reviews/nvidia-omniverse-review-9905699), Tasneem G.

#### **What I dislike about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

- I do not like that the platform is plugin-dependent and relies on these integrations with external tools, which can lead to compatibility issues or require frequent updates to keep up with its functionality across different teams.
- I dislike how niche-focused this application is, meaning independent or entry-level users might not find the app as useful or a bit of overkill.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

“NVIDIA Omniverse has a very complicated initial setup and installation process. It is a hardware-dependent program that needs a high-end GPU to function.”- [NVIDIA Omniverse Review](https://www.g2.com/products/nvidia-omniverse/reviews/nvidia-omniverse-review-9488246), Atharva V.

## 8\. Adobe Dimension: Best for photorealistic 3D product mockups

[Adobe Dimension](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-dimension/reviews) is a 3D design, modeling, and rendering software that focuses on rendering photorealistic 3D images. I’ve seen this application used to build brand visualizations, illustrations, and product mockups. I had fun using this tool for a project to showcase a drink advertisement model.

![Adobe Dimension](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfm7l7ZXgjgjNN8JmtQ5ZR1hFfdpX40kCu91Lwki6trqjtWvBFHsp5JPrr22LtK-j58YdNq6SEntrRofHF-2-VBhmx7g2e6lBS99Udh0B_eJ7O4ij31lbvo4HawkXVbbtoWNQpv4w?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

What I loved most about Adobe Dimension was that it offered a pre-made asset library consisting of a variety of 3D models, materials, lighting setups, and more. I loved that this was one of the applications I used that offered pre-built lighting setups — as I am terrible at setting up the perfect lighting. I love that the tool bridges the gap between 2D and 3D design, which helps aspiring graphic designers create 3D visuals without the need to learn advanced 3D modeling or rendering.

I also have to mention that Dimension has great photorealistic rendering capabilities. I believe Adobe prides itself on this feature alone. Dimension’s ability to simulate realistic lighting and texture makes it a prominent standout feature.

The integration with Creative Cloud makes it especially convenient for designers who already work with Photoshop or Illustrator, and G2 users often point out how seamless that creative handoff feels across Adobe’s ecosystem.

That said, I’ve found that Dimension isn’t really built for creating original 3D models from the ground up. While it does a great job letting you place and render existing 3D assets, it doesn’t offer full modeling functionality. When I wanted more control over object geometry or to tweak pre-built models in detail, I ran into limitations. Based on reviews on G2, this is a common observation—many users enjoy the rendering quality but note that editing capabilities are fairly minimal.

I also noticed the absence of features like ray tracing or native support for engines like V-Ray, which you might expect in more robust 3D software. That said, for packaging visuals, product previews, or marketing materials where fast, attractive rendering is the priority, Adobe Dimension holds up well—especially for those already familiar with Adobe’s creative suite.

#### **What I like about Adobe Dimension:**

- I like how easy Adobe Dimension is to use. Since the application is dependent on pre-built models, it’s easy to set up a stage for my ad project and requires little learning time.
- Since this is an Adobe app, I like that I could integrate this app with other Adobe Creative Cloud applications, like Photoshop.

#### **What do G2 users like about Adobe Dimension:**

“Dimensions bring 3-D mockups and rendering to the hands of graphic designers, I had struggled trying to learn C4D and Blinder in order to bring a 3D mockup or to get product shots to use in posters and social media ads, but dimensions made that very easy, you don't have to worry about texture and lighting and render sitting, you just choose what suits you off the list and there it is ready for you

\- [Adobe Dimension Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-dimension/reviews/adobe-dimension-review-8535460), Mohammad K.

#### **What I dislike about Adobe Dimension:**

- Just like all Adobe apps, I do not like subscription-based applications, and Adobe Dimension can be a bit expensive for occasional users, like myself.
- I dislike the 3D modeling limitations of this app. Dimension focused on product visualization and setting up a stage for brand and marketing, so it wasn’t as suitable for someone like me who wanted to use the tool for animation and game design.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Adobe Dimension:**

“The downsides are mostly around pricing, but for professionals, this is just a small cost per month that is fully deductible, unlike an outright purchase. Another negative, though less visible, is the number of "helpers" that run in the background and the need for an always-on internet connection.”- [Adobe Dimension Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-creative-cloud/reviews/adobe-creative-cloud-review-8615706), Daniel M.

## 9\. Recap: Best for converting real-world data to 3D models

[ReCap](https://www.g2.com/products/recap/reviews), short for “Reality Capture,” is an Autodesk platform used for 3D scanning and 2D drawing. It captures photos or scans and turns them into detailed 3D models. This application is mainly used by those interested in architecture or engineering. Many surveyors also use it to create terrain maps and land surveys.

![ReCap](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXep3Sij6bC0cehHKeoYHEASoZQiwZwO3O_rgHHZde9GBP-hZuocuiEvk39xYaPIV8MlSHSfvpSEvOqHX_1bPUg6W_LWlQoSBPw8mR7ecHvHEpTDb96PHQRvDSrjuWrSK1Dhuh3BeQ?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

I briefly experimented with this application. For this article, I did do a few weeks of research with the use of the 30-day free trial offered by Autodesk.What I like most about the ReCap app is how effective it was at accurately capturing scans or photos that I imported from the tool. It was impressive that it was able to turn pictures of real-life architecture from multiple angles and create a 3D model of that architecture. ReCap supports multiple integrations, such as AutoCAD, Revit, and Navisworks. It also supports a wide range of input data, including LiDAR scans, drone mapping, 2D images, and land surveys, making this tool incredibly versatile. Another feature I liked is that ReCap offers RealView Navigation, which allows users to navigate the 3D models as if they’re walking through that space.

ReCap has been incredibly useful when it comes to converting real-world scans into accurate 3D models. I found it especially helpful for site surveys and capturing architectural environments in detail. According to several G2 reviewers, ReCap’s strength lies in its precision and automation—it streamlines the reality capture process and integrates well with other Autodesk products for construction and design.

However, I did find that its editing capabilities are fairly limited. While it’s excellent at processing point clouds and photogrammetry data, making detailed changes to those models often required me to export the file and refine it in another application. From what I’ve seen on G2, others have echoed this point—ReCap serves as a solid first step in the workflow, but isn't a one-stop solution for full 3D editing.

I also noticed that integration with non-Autodesk tools felt somewhat restricted. The software is clearly optimized for users already in the Autodesk ecosystem, which makes sense, but it did limit my flexibility when I wanted to incorporate it into different pipelines. Exporting options were also more limited in the free version, which is something G2 users frequently point out as a factor to consider when evaluating which license tier to choose.

Still, for accurately capturing and processing real-world environments, ReCap is a strong choice—especially if you're already working within Autodesk’s suite of tools.

#### **What I like about ReCap:**

- What impressed me about this app was how accurately it was able to capture scans and photos I imported and take those photos and create navigational 3D models completed from every angle.
- I also liked how this application supports many data types, from LiDAR scans and drone maps to 2D images and land surveys. It made options nearly limitless.

#### **What do G2 users like about ReCap:**

“Recap serves primarily to transform photographs into point clouds, which can be effectively utilized in Building Information Modeling (BIM). This software proves highly advantageous to BIM engineers, significantly assisting in the process of 3D modeling within Revit.”

\- [ReCap Review](https://www.g2.com/products/recap/reviews/recap-review-8266996), Kishore K.

#### **What I dislike about ReCap:**

- While I do think this application is cool, it does lack advanced tools for detailed modifications, and in some cases for me to tweak the model, I had to make these modifications in tools like AutoCAD and resubmitting that scan in ReCap.
- I did not like that the software was confined to Autodesk applications and the restrictive options for exporting the final product, especially in the free or basic version.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about ReCap:**

“The user interface of this software is a bit tricky to use. This software do not have many options to customise the feature that are being used on daily basis us.”- [ReCap Review](https://www.g2.com/products/recap/reviews/recap-review-7505966), Devendra S.

## 10\. Adobe Substance: Best for creating realistic textures

[Adobe Substance 3D Sampler](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-substance-3d-sampler/reviews) is an extension app for Adobe’s Substance 3D tool and is used to design, create, and edit realistic materials and textures for 3D models. It’s a 3D scanning software that uses AI to create high-quality 3D materials. Many users, especially those using other Adobe applications will use this tool to help create additional attributes to add to their 3D models. This application is mainly used to create hyper-realistic materials that can be integrated into larger 3D models.

![Adobe Substance 3D Sampler](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfLD-SuuknWBGZ2uacT9EZ2CNmq6WflxY4vezm33c4gaCMbYjaO6RjBJrqVrtaE_IvA1p6WRL-sD9hfSx60gc_4FEHB-qAu3z2sbbV2oywjd4hnQDYogO6eAk17Gz4n0jdm3bET?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Some features that I love about this application include its AI-powered material feature and the beginner-friendly UI. The app uses Adobe Sensei AI to assist in converting photos and scans into high-quality tileable 3D materials. In addition, the interface is also easy to use with its clean and innovative workflow. Both of these features help save time and effort for designers or users wanting quick results.

The tool also generates materials with PBR (Physically Based Rendering) maps, such as base colors and roughness of a texture.  This means that the application can render my projects with simulated light that naturally interacts with materials in the real world, so I don’t have to edit the light source myself.

Substance 3D Sampler has been a game-changer for me when it comes to creating highly realistic textures. I love how easily it turns real-world images into PBR materials, and the AI-powered enhancement tools help streamline what would otherwise be a time-intensive process. Many creators on G2 also mention how the app simplifies material generation while maintaining an impressive level of detail.

That said, I did notice that the application can be quite demanding on hardware—especially when processing high-resolution textures or working on large-scale projects. In my experience, things slowed down significantly when the scene became more complex, and G2 reviewers have noted similar issues with lag or occasional crashes, particularly on mid-range machines.

Another thing to be mindful of is that the output quality is heavily dependent on the source images. When I fed in lower-quality or slightly blurry photos, the resulting materials needed a lot of cleanup. This aligns with what others on G2 have said: the better your input, the better the outcome. It’s definitely worth curating high-quality source material if you want consistent, professional results.

Still, for creating photorealistic textures with minimal manual effort, Substance 3D Sampler offers a powerful and time-saving workflow—especially if you pair it with other tools in Adobe’s Substance suite.

#### **What I like about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

- One feature I absolutely love is the PBR map generation feature, which mimics real-world material behavior under lighting, so I don’t have the edit the lights and shadows of an object, myself. This saves me a ton of time!
- The UI is very clean and direct, making the app incredibly easy to navigate, even for a beginner like myself. Its creative workflow allows me to focus more on creativity and less on trying to figure out how the tool works.

#### **What do G2 users like about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

“It's good for the Texturing and working on the real based Texturing and very nice output for the any working like movie and gaming and product because it's work on the real based tendering.”

\- [Adobe Substance 3D Sampler Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-substance-3d-sampler/reviews/adobe-substance-3d-sampler-review-7262971), Yash A.

#### **What I dislike about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

- I dislike how resource-heavy the app is. It’s a real resource hog for processing high-res texture and working on larger projects. I’ve experienced multiple lags and occasional crashes at the time.
- I wish the application was an all-in-one software, however, it’s niche-focused and only specializes in texture creation, which it is great at, but I feel like the app would be more versatile if it offered more 3D modeling functionalities, like mesh creation and sculpting.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

“It is still like a few more tools that are specific to textiles and fashion. Transparency can be really important, so if there was a way to pick out areas of transparency to make the alpha map would be great. In fact, if there were more tools to actually create maps for specific areas of the fabric would be great. In Style3D fabric, for example, I can use an eye dropper tool or paintbrush to define specific areas of metalness or transparency. This is helpful for fabrics that are not evenly metallic or all one opaqueness.”- [Adobe Substance 3D Sampler Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-substance-3d-sampler/reviews/adobe-substance-3d-sampler-review-8175465), Joneien J.

Creating custom 3D models for your games can breathe the personalized charm into your Games in an instant but unfortunately, that isn’t the way for some Indie Developers who are starting out or don’t have enough time to create their own 3D models from scratch and they often go the route of buying 3D models from the marketplaces. Whether you are a beginner or a professional, an easy to access and intuitive 3D modeling software can provide a lot of creative freedom for both concepting and final modeling. But learning a full-fledged 3D software suite for smaller tasks is a headache if rushed through during the learning phase.

Dust3D is a new entrant in the market that offers intuitive tools and fast workflow for speeding through the modeling process, cutting down the modeling times and complexity while providing tools for all sorts of modeling paradigms like UV Unwrapping, Rigging, Pose and Motion Authoring and more. The icing on the cake? They are an Epic MegaGrants recipient, so expect great things to come from the developers in the future. Also, the program is cross-platform, so no matter what OS you use (Windows, macOS, or Linux), they’ve got you covered with the same experience while using it.

[![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b03158_520103b585864c40a260a08533b98478~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_49,h_28,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/b03158_520103b585864c40a260a08533b98478~mv2.png)](https://dust3d.org/)

The modeling approach is quite unique with a node-based modeling workflow in which you create nodes instead of polygons and the nodes are meshed and skinned accordingly to make a 3D Model. You’ve got to try it out to understand its potential as a great concepting tool.

> As they quote on their website, “With Dust3D, you'll see yourself finish a game asset in a blink! Dust3D also supports export your model as FBX and glTF format, so that you can then import the files into softwares like Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot for further development.”

# Roblox releases its open source model that can create 3D objects using AI

[Lauren Forristal](https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/)

6:30 AM PDT · March 17, 2025

Roblox [announced](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/03/introducing-roblox-cube) Monday that it’s launching the first iteration of its 3D model, dubbed “Cube,” to allow creators to create 3D objects using generative AI. The company also launched an open source version so anyone off the platform can build on it.

Announced last year at Roblox’s [annual developer conference](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/roblox-introduces-new-earning-opportunities-for-creators-teases-generative-ai-project/), the company is demoing Cube at the Game Developers Conference ( [GDC](https://gdconf.com/)) later this afternoon.

Creators will have access to Cube later this week, which includes its first tool: mesh generation.

Cube’s 3D mesh generation, currently available in beta, enables creators to “meshes,” or 3D representations of objects, using a single prompt. For instance, “generate an orange racing car with black stripes.” Creators can further adjust the in-game item within Roblox Studio.

The open source version of Cube 3D allows anyone to customize, create plug-ins, or train the model with their own datasets to fit their needs.

Roblox also announced three additional AI tools — text generation, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. These capabilities will launch in the coming months.

The text generation tool lets developers add text-based AI features to their games. This includes giving players the option of having conversations with interactive non-player characters (NPCs).

Text-to-speech, meanwhile, lets developers add narration, have NPCs speak, or include spoken captions in their games. Speech-to-text allows players to use voice commands, like directing characters to move forward.

Other future plans the company has include launching mesh generation for more “complex” objects and scene generation, Roblox explains. The scene generation tool, for instance, will allow creators to prompt the AI to make a full forest scene and change the green leaves on trees to fall colors to show the season changing.

As Roblox previously stated last year, the long-term goal is to have the 3D objects and scenes fully functional, which it calls “4D creation.”

“Where the fourth dimension is interaction between objects, environments, and people,” Nick Tornow, vice president of engineering at Roblox, told TechCrunch.

As with any company exploring generative AI tools, Roblox believes Cube will help creators work faster, allowing indie developers to take on bigger projects. The company has already released several AI tools, including for [texture generation and avatar creation](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/robloxs-ai-features-create-avatars-3d-models/).

AI tools in gaming are a hot topic, with several companies making advancements in the space. Most recently, Tencent launched its open source [3D generation model](https://3d-models.hunyuan.tencent.com/), designed to generate 3D models through text prompts or 2D images.

However, the use of AI continues to raise concerns within the industry. As indicated in [GDC’s recent report](https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more), 30% of game developers feel that generative AI is negatively affecting the gaming space. According to a [CVL Economics study](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ce331b47a39b9000198fffa/t/65b9314fd6198f70b0ec7402/1706635612414/Future+Unscripted+-+The+Impact+of+Generative+Artificial+Intelligence+on+Entertainment+Industry+Jobs+-+pages_compressed.pdf), it’s projected that 13.4% of gaming jobs could be impacted or replaced by AI by 2026.

**Introduction**

In this article, we will explore the fascinating world of 3D modeling. We will discuss its evolution over time and take a glimpse into what the future holds for this rapidly advancing technology. At a glance, we will learn the following.

## **1.0 What is 3D Modeling**

**1.1 Definition:**

3D stands for three-dimensional. It means something that has height, width, and depth. If you delve into the origin of the term “Modeling”, it stems from Latin “Modulus”. This term was once used to denote a building plan in the 16th century. However, now, the word “Modeling” has a much wider meaning. 3D Modeling is the process of making things that you can measure all three dimensions of and move around or orbit around.

**In one sentence, 3D modeling is a technique used in computer graphics to create digital representations of objects or surfaces.**

**1.2 Description:**

3D modeling is a fascinating technique used in computer graphics that allows for the creation of a three-dimensional digital representation of any object or surface. This process is carried out using specialized software, where an artist manipulates points in virtual space. These points are known as [vertices](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/structure.html) where 3D coordinates (x, y, z) connect the edges of the model in a 3d space.

The collection of these vertices forms what is known as a mesh. This mesh is essentially the skeleton of the 3D model, providing its shape and structure. The more detailed the mesh, the more detailed and realistic the final 3D model will be.

Once the basic shape of the 3D model is created, the next step is often to add textures. [Texturing](https://helpx.adobe.com/beta/fuse/help/3d-visual-dictionary.html) involves applying a ‘skin’ over the mesh of the model. This skin can include details like color, shininess, roughness, and transparency. It’s this step that brings the 3D model to life, making it look more realistic.

Lighting techniques are also crucial in 3D modeling. By adjusting the direction, intensity, and color of light, artists can create shadows and highlights on the model, giving it depth and making it appear more three-dimensional.

3D models are used in a wide range of fields. In the entertainment industry, they’re used to create characters and environments for video games and movies. In architecture, 3D models are used to create detailed plans and virtual walk through of buildings before they’re built. In the field of engineering, 3D models can help with visualizing complex machinery and systems. Even in commercial advertising, 3D models are used to create eye-catching visuals.

**Summary:**

3D modeling is a powerful tool that combines art and technology to create detailed, realistic representations of objects and environments. It’s a process that requires both technical skill and artistic vision, and its applications are vast and varied.

## **2.0 Evolution of 3D Modeling**

**2.1 Early Beginnings**

The roots of 3D modeling can be traced back to the early 1960s when Ivan Sutherland developed Sketchpad, which is considered the first computer-aided design (CAD) program. This groundbreaking software laid the foundation for the creation of three-dimensional models on a computer.

**2.2 Advancements in Technology and Techniques**

As technology progressed, so did the capabilities of 3D modeling. The introduction of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the 1970s revolutionized the field by dramatically increasing the speed and quality of rendering. Additionally, advancements in algorithms and software made it easier for artists and designers to create complex and realistic 3D models.

**2.3 Integration in Various Industries**

The use of 3D modeling expanded beyond the realm of computer graphics and animation. Today, it plays a crucial role in industries such as architecture, engineering, manufacturing, and entertainment. Architects can create detailed virtual representations of buildings before construction begins, engineers can simulate and test product designs, and filmmakers can bring fantastical worlds to life on the silver screen.

**Summary:**

3D modeling originated in the 1960s with the development of the first CAD program. Over time, advancements in technology and software made it easier to create realistic 3D models. Today, 3D modeling is widely used in industries such as architecture, engineering, manufacturing, and entertainment for various purposes like virtual representations, product design simulations, and film production.

Text: I am very excited to share that this month we are launching Blender Essentials taught by 3D designer Robin Ruud. Pre-register for the course here and be among the first to hear when it launches. In this post, we will explore what Blender is, which are its main features, why it is the first choice for millions of users worldwide and how it compares with other tools like Cinema 4D, 3ds, and more!  When you become a BYOL member, you gain access to this new Blender course as well as my 30+ additional courses on Photoshop, Lightroom, InDesign, Figma, and more. As a BYOL member you will also enjoy personalized support, earn certificates, and tackle exciting community challenges. Head here to sign-up! What is Blender? Blender is hardly a new arrival to the 3D industry. It was founded in 1994, made available to the public in 1998, and finally presented as open source in 2002, after a successful crowdfunding campaign. Blender is a free 3D graphics suite, designed to run on Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, and used for creating 3D models, animation, video games, and even visual effects for the movie industry. The list goes on and on! I'm sure you've heard of the Oscar-winning animation film "Flow". Blender! Isn't that amazing? Thanks to its built-in features and powerful add-ons, it was possible to take this incredible story to the Academy Awards stage! Ah, I can almost see you dreaming out loud, now! Who could tell that a free, open source, software could rival - and beat - some industry heavy hitters? Hey, but that's not all! There are other awesome projects that used Blender as an active tool across the development stages, also known in the industry as 3D pipeline: Spider-Man: No Way Home (film) – Concept design and pre-visualization. Prey – (film) Visual Effects and environment design. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (videogame) – Asset modelling. Cyberpunk 2077 (videogame) – Asset development. The Man in the High Castle (TV show) – Visual Effects Here’s the good news: You can download, install, and start using this software right now, without having to subscribe to a monthly plan or paying a one-time fee. If you are not familiar with the term, "open source" means that the software is publicly available. Fixes, improvements, and updates are developed by members of the Blender community, in a collaborative spirit that benefits all. Cool, huh? This means that you can now access Blender and explore its huge potential and features, no matter if you are a beginner to the world of 3D graphics or an experienced professional, using the software to learn, upgrade your business and reach new markets, or simply have fun creating 3D print models for a hobby!  Awesome! Why use Blender? Blender is an amazing three-dimensional graphics suite, used by artists and designers, animators and film studios, game developers, and even engineers and scientists, because it allows you to work across the entire 3D pipeline -- or workflow stages of 3D design. Feeling a bit overwhelmed? We're here for you! Let's begin by having a quick look at the most common features available in Blender. There’s much much to do in Blender! Best strategy is exploring each feature, step-by-step. 3D modelling – Allows creating new objects from basic shapes like cubes, spheres, or cylinders, cutting, stretching, and reshaping them into more complex objects. Think about building blocks or Adobe Illustrator’s Shape Builder tool but set in a three-dimensional world interface. Texturing and Shading – The next steps after 3D modelling, we can add texture, detail, or lighting effects, bringing realism to the designed 3D objects. Rigging and Animation – Think about animating a 3D character, making it walk, run, or sit down. Rigging adds a structure, a skeleton and joints to support the 3D model, allowing for setting poses and movement. Rendering – Converts the 3D model into a finished image or video, with high-quality shapes and textures, lighting, shadows, and reflections. Visual Effects (Compositing) and Video Editing – Now let’s think of a Hollywood blockbuster! Compositing is all about replacing a green screen background into a completely new landscape or environment and adding visual effects and CGI (computer generated imagery) to real-life footage. Video editors arrange, cut, trim, and edit the footage into a final visual product, like a movie or a documentary. This is how detailed we can get in Blender, from basic character sculpting to finished render. It sounds like a lot, I know, and when you look at all the interface options, menus, and panels it's perfectly fine to feel a bit intimidated, but that's all normal! If you learn consistently and practice your skills, it will all start flowing smoothly and be fun! Next question! Is Blender a smart choice for Beginners? Blender is, for sure, a smart choice for everyone who wants to start learning and designing 3D graphics. It's free, available across multiple operating systems, and covers the relevant stages of 3D design and animation. Keep in mind, of course, that there is a learning curve to Blender. First, you must realign your mindset with a new three-dimensional workspace (X, Y, and Z axes will become your new best friends). Blender's all-in-one superpower also means that it takes time to get used to a complex user interface, to a considerable range of menus, tools, and shortcuts that require a step-by-step approach in the first days and weeks. As you learn and practice, things get easier and more comfortable, but it's important to accept that it takes time to get there. Don't begin by producing your own animated movie! To help users across this learning curve, Blender benefits from a vast array of documentation, tutorials, courses, online groups and forums, in one of the largest communities in the 3D design industry. 3D modelling is like sculpting in stone or shaping clay, with the perk of seeing the artwork come to life! Does Blender run on any computer? Even though Blender is a bit lighter on computer resources than some of its competitors, 3D modelling and rendering is always demanding, so there are recommended software and hardware requirements for each operating system. Verify these requirements to ensure that the software will run smoothly and prevent crashes and frustration. The software download on Blender's website, for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Installing it on your computer is quick and easy, it will only take a few minutes! I have a feeling we will see a lot more of this nice monkey! Blender add-ons If you are not entirely new to the design adventure, I'm sure you have heard terms like plug-ins and add-ons. These are additional tools, usually developed by third-party companies, that enhance a software's built-in features and help streamline your work, so you can be the first at the finish line in a very competitive market. Blender is not an exception for this, and you can count on a huge and growing collection of add-ons and resources that will speed things up and brighten up your work, keeping your mind less worried about deadlines and more focused on creativity! Some of them are also free, others have a price tag on them, so take some time to learn what they do and if they fit your project's budget. Let's scroll through some of these gems, just for you to know that no matter how complicated a project may seem, there is always an add-on to take you above and beyond.   Modeling and Sculpting Sculpt Toolkit – Free – This add-on speeds up organic sculpting (awesome for characters and creatures), improves user interface settings, and makes mask creating and mesh extraction easier. HardOps &amp; Boxcutter – Paid - Used by 3D modelers, game artists, and concept designers, HardOps delivers a toolkit that will make modelling a lot more dynamic and safer. BoxCutter allows for fast and precise shape cutting into 3D models.    Texturing and Shading Node Wrangler – free and built-in – Saves tons of time when working with materials by speeding up shade editing and providing shortcuts for quick linking, previewing textures, and managing shader nodes. TexTools – Free – Used by game developers, texture artists, and asset creators, TexTools improves UV mapping, baking, and texturing tools in Blender.  Rendering and Lighting Easy HDRI – Free – Simplifies HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging) by allowing for only-click setup for lighting settings, for realistic lighting effects in 3D scenes. K-Cycles – Paid – Used by architects, animators, and visual effects professionals, speeds up to 2x rendering, denoising, and caustics processes, in certain scenarios.  Animations and Rigging Animation Nodes – Free – Similar to Blender’s Geometry Nodes, but more focused on motion and effects, allows for complex motion graphics and procedural animations that include object animation, particles, and deformation. Auto-rig Pro – Paid – Allows for the automatic rigging of characters, creatures, and mechanical objects, saving hours of manual work in character design. Supports game engines like Unity and Unreal. Wow, look at all the detail and the structure that supports the 3D model! How awesome is this? Blender vs Competition Can a free tool match premium competitors and industry standards? Let’s see how Blender behaves in a side-by-side competition with other 3D design apps, based on a set of core features that may support you on how you plan your full journey from a first 3D cube with a light fixture to a Hollywood Oscar Winning production! These are only some of Blender's competitors, but I believe this selection casts good light on how Blender can be a smart first choice to start mastering the Essentials of 3D design and how you can, soon, pick a specific field to become a specialist. Let's finish with a quick recap! Blender – Strengths and weaknesses If you are considering stepping into the world of 3D design (and I know you are!), it makes sense that you understand why Blender can be the right choice of software for you as well as its limitations. Pros Value – Blender is free for personal and commercial use. There are no plans or licenses surrounding its core functionality. All-in-One – Blender is a do-it-all solution, you can tackle a complex 3D project from early modelling to rendering or video compositing inside one single piece of software. Did I mention it’s also free? Updates and Support – For Blender, open source means there are frequent updates that fix bugs, improve its features and performance. Support from an expanding community and a wide array of learning resources add a layer of confidence in a software with a considerable learning curve. And it’s free! Lightweight and Versatile – Blender is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux and runs well without you having to invest in top notch hardware, like some of its competitors. For free! Add-on Collections – There is a huge library of free (and paid) add-ons for Blender that bring additional resources, assist on its limited collaboration features, and save valuable workflow time. Well, many of these are free! Sign up to the Course, this Pop Art masterpiece is expecting you! Cons Learning Curve – Even if balanced with strong learning resources and community support, it is true that Blender’s unique interface, shortcut-based workflow, and the need for a certain level of previous technical knowledge to tackle tasks like animation rigging, makes it a bit harder for beginners and gets easier with time and practice. Freelance and Indie Power Tool – Blender is growing fast worldwide and is continuously evolving because of its open source side, but it is still not an industry standard. This is particularly felt in the major Film and Video Game producers and developers. Limited Collaboration – Blender doesn’t have built-in and real-time collaboration tools, some manual linking or third-party add-ons are required to compensate for this limitation. Performance and Stability Issues – Projects with complex meshes and high detail can be heavy on computer resources, when compared to some competitors that are more focused on specific steps in the pipeline. It’s a work in progress – Some features like character animation or sculpting still need further development, but again, its open source policy brings constant updates and improvements. And There We Have It! Alright, now that you have a clearer idea of what Blender represents in the 3D design world of wonders, join Robin and me at Bring your Own Laptop and sign up to the new course Blender Essentials! Remember, Blender is free, accessible across platforms, includes all the necessary features for you to explore all the steps in a 3D pipeline, and turn you into an all-round 3D designer!

## 10 best 3D modeling software that I reviewed (and liked)

If I had to explain what 3D modeling software was in an “elevator pitch”, I would describe 3D modeling software as a computer program that transforms your ideas or designs into three-dimensional forms, or 3D. The resulting 3D models can be used by many to visualize a product, an object, a person, a character, simulations, and anything you can think of that you would like to communicate to others visually. For me, 3D modeling software plays a crucial role in visualization and design communication. Instead of archaic blueprints and wasted paper to illustrate a point, 3D modeling can show us details of an object from different angles. We no longer need to build the final prototype to see the functionality in real-time. I also love that with 3D modeling software becoming an evolving tool, many applications offer team collaboration features and integrations with other apps to enhance workflow.

#### How did I find and evaluate the best 3D modeling apps?

When putting together this list, I drew on my journey of testing 3D modeling tools over several years and my current experience, re-testing the tools again this year. In addition, I also collaborated with professionals and did extensive research, gathering honest feedback on what others have experienced using these products.

I explored which tools excelled at certain projects, where they fell short, and whether I felt they were worth your time and investment. Using [G2](https://www.g2.com/) Grid Reports and product reviews, I leveraged artificial intelligence to analyze real users’ wants, needs, and pain points for each tool.

In cases where I couldn’t personally test a tool due to limited access, I consulted a professional with hands-on experience and validated their insights using verified G2 reviews. The screenshots featured in this article may be a mix of those captured during testing and ones obtained from the vendor’s G2 page.

### What factors do I think make the best 3d modeling software worth it

3D modeling has seen significant growth over the past few years, and because of this, the software market is saturated with various 3D modeling programs to choose from. Choosing the right 3D modeling software depends on a variety of factors. Here are the factors I paid attention to when choosing the best 3D modeling tool for me:

- **Ease of Use:** In my experience, choosing the best 3D modeling software starts with determining your skill level. These tools have a lot of features and before you can dive right into using one of these tools, you need to determine how much time you want to dedicate to learning an application.
- **Budget:** Budget has always been on my mind, especially in this economy. I’m always trying to save where I can. That’s why I must factor in how much I am willing to spend on a 3D modeling tool. Do I want to commit to a monthly subscription or pay an annual fee? If you have budget limitations, trying an open-source or [free 3D modeling software](https://learn.g2.com/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybi5nMi5jb20vMTAtYmVzdC1mcmVlLTNkLW1vZGVsaW5nLXNvZnR3YXJl&ct=SEARCH&pid=4099946&cid=112697286062&t=M2QgbW9kZWxpbmc%3D&d=learn.g2.com&c=2&c=3&c=6&rp=1&ab=false&opcid=&rs=UNKNOWN&hs-expires=1768519090&hs-version=1&hs-signature=APUk-v4U-ybttJ0fs-VEMC76UEbFpvg3oQ&hsLang=en) might be better for you.
- **Feature and App Compatibility:** The features an application offers make a huge difference in how effective that app is going to be for my projects. If my goal is to create [3D-printed](https://learn.g2.com/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybi5nMi5jb20vZnJlZS0zZC1wcmludGluZy1zb2Z0d2FyZQ%3D%3D&ct=SEARCH&pid=4099946&cid=10356706509&t=M2QgbW9kZWxpbmc%3D&d=learn.g2.com&c=2&c=3&c=6&rp=5&ab=false&opcid=&rs=UNKNOWN&hs-expires=1768519090&hs-version=1&hs-signature=APUk-v5KCGm_4bHMvlIvnrIs2A5HjnNhbA&hsLang=en) models, then using an application that integrates with a 3D printer is necessary. Depending on my project needs, it is one of the biggest decision-making factors in choosing the best software.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** It’s important when choosing a 3D modeling software, that it be compatible with your device. Whether it be a Mac, PC, or a mobile device. It is important to make sure your device runs applications without overheating or crashing. That’s why I always check the minimum hardware specs needed for a 3D modeling tool, since they can be pretty impressive applications.
- **Collaboration and Team Workflow:** Another important factor that I would consider is the app’s ability to collaborate with others. Some of your projects might be a group project, which means different people might be working off the same file. Real-time tools or cloud-based capabilities might help enhance workflow across teams.
- **Community Support:**  Finding an application that has a strong community and good support system makes a huge difference, especially when you are stuck on an issue. In addition, when there is a large community that uses the same tool, there are generally tutorials and resources you can find that others have created to help you learn new tricks or solve problems along the way.

By considering these factors, I’ve been able to choose the best 3D modeling software that works for me. I’ve tested more than 15 3D modeling platforms that fit my criteria. Of the 15 I tested, these are the top 10 3D modeling products that stood out for their functionality, compatibility, features, performance, and community support.The list below contains genuine user feedback from the 3D modeling software category. It’s important to note that in the context of this list, vendors offering a free trial are also considered free.

## 1\. Sketchup: Best for simple architectural modeling

[SketchUp](https://www.g2.com/products/sketchup/reviews) (formerly Google SketchUp) is a premiere 3D modeling software that is used to create and edit 3D models with the “Push and Pull” method. This method allows designers to take a flat surface and mold it into a 3D form. I’ve seen many projects created in SketchUp, such as interior design stages, video game design, and architecture. Ranked as a Leader on the G2 3D Modeling Software Grid, SketchUp remains a top choice for fast, accessible architectural modeling.

As of 2025, SketchUp holds a [24.96% market share](https://6sense.com/tech/3d-modeling/sketchup-market-share) in the 3D modeling tools segment, with over 3,659 companies using it.

![sketchup](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd36WAjroI2UxJGiT00Avlqz7wLwKvzbmLjfnoM6Z05QRiPcPWf25qCcquXVv2n9UuisClFpIrrPwNYvp6HlFb9pykBxRNs41wBTtwhHVLd4fBxZMJV5dcC6PQCGO9V9cKF2Eeq?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Recently, I started using the SketchUp Free subscription, which is their web-based version that offers limited features. However, I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about software that I might not have considered otherwise, without a budget penalty.There are a few reasons I put SketchUp on this list. SketchUp is one of the few 3D modeling programs that offers an intuitive interface and therefore a minimal learning curve, making it a favorite among beginners or professionals looking for quick results. There is also a wide library of extensions and plugins that you can use to improve your models, including the 3D Warehouse (SketchUp Warehouse), which offers a bunch of pre-made 3D models that you can experiment with or add to your models. Lastly, the platform integrates with a variety of other platforms, such as AutoCAD, Revit, and rendering engines like V-Ray. I’ve also seen it integrate with Google Earth, which is pretty neat!

While I found SketchUp incredibly easy to learn and helpful for quickly drafting architectural concepts, I noticed that it's not really built for more advanced modeling workflows. For example, when I wanted to explore sculpting or parametric design, I had to look elsewhere. Based on G2 user feedback, this is a fairly common limitation. Many users mention SketchUp’s simplicity as both a strength and a constraint, depending on the complexity of your project.

The rendering capabilities also lean more toward functional than photorealistic. If you’re aiming to produce lifelike visuals directly within the software, you may find yourself turning to third-party tools. G2 customer reviews mention using additional rendering plug-ins to bridge this gap.

As someone dabbling in animation, I also noticed SketchUp isn't really geared toward that use case. It's best suited for static models or layout visualization. According to Verified reviews on G2, animation support isn’t a major focus here, and that’s something to keep in mind if you're looking for an all-in-one tool for modeling and animation.

Lastly, while I appreciate the streamlined interface, pricing can be a consideration depending on the features you need.

#### **What I like about SketchUp:**

- With SketchUp’s “Push and Pull” method, this 3D modeling app is created for beginners just starting out, like me, when I first started using this software. The method is incredibly intuitive, allowing me to transform flat surfaces into 3D forms with a few clicks.
- I also love how SketchUp offers a rich, vast library of extensions I can add to enhance my 3D models, as well as a 3D warehouse with pre-built models that I can add to my project.

#### **What do G2 users like about SketchUp:**

“Sketchup is a pretty intuitive program to learn from the moment you start. I like all of the free plug-ins and the support videos. Layout is a great extension as well, just wish it was a little easier to use for some things.”

\- [SketchUp Review](https://www.g2.com/products/sketchup/reviews/sketchup-review-5354405), Brian P.

#### **What I dislike about SketchUp:**

- I felt that despite the many features SketchUp had, it was lacking in creating complex forms because it didn’t have as well-equipped features as some other 3D modeling software I have used— like parametric design, sculpting, and photorealistic rendering.
- Another dislike that I have for the app, is its limitation on export files. This is especially true for the free version. These are just some of the files I was unable to export: .stp, .iges, .fbx.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about SketchUp:**

“While SketchUp excels in many areas, there are a few drawbacks, especially when it comes to 3D printing. The software isn’t specifically designed for creating models intended for 3D printing, which can lead to issues like non-manifold geometry, overlapping faces, or gaps in the model. These issues often require additional time for troubleshooting and fixing before a model is ready for printing. Additionally, the precision tools in SketchUp, while sufficient for many design tasks, can sometimes feel limiting when exact measurements and tolerances are critical for 3D printing. This can result in models that don’t print as intended without further refinement in more specialized 3D printing software.”- [SketchUp Review](https://www.g2.com/products/sketchup/reviews/sketchup-review-10032925), Loi T.

## 2\. Blender: Best for open-source 3D creation suite

[Blender](https://www.g2.com/products/blender/reviews) is an open-source 3D modeling software that allows users to create 3D models, animations, and visual effects. Blender is a free software and one of the few fully accessible 3D software that you can share or use without limitations. Top-rated Blender alternatives on G2 include Unity, Cinema 4D, and 3ds Max Design—each offering distinct strengths in animation, motion graphics, and architectural modeling.

I’ve been using Blender since high school when the Blender 2.69 version was out. The latest and last version I used before I decided on a career switch was Blender 4.0, but it’s amazing to see that Blender keeps updating periodically. It is now, as of writing this article, at Blender 4.3. With this update, I started dabbling into again. That’s one of the reasons I love this application —despite the platform maintaining its free version, it has a loyal fanbase. It’s clear the developers listen to their community and work hard to keep evolving the software.

![Blender](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXesjY9WnE24apWlEd3pzaQiatoO3Lf3NKWYfX6j216IngMyv0MMqdxE5dugcBKuakfsOUcsxMDsOb_4_0BkKX25sP7WO3fxBEyXPzujzmfLuZUdPBOcfQCRD36r17paWWmTPUSDMw?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Other than the fact that Blender is one of the most robust applications that remains free to its users, because of the massive support there are a ton of learning tools and resources that I have found over the years that helped me dive even deeper into this application.In addition to these factors, I also love Blender’s powerful render engines, Eevee and Cycles (what cute names). Both of these render engines offer real-time rendering and photorealistic results, which cater to a variety of projects and complex workflows. Blender also offers cross-platform compatibility, which means the app can work on different operating systems like macOS, Windows, and Linux.

From modeling and sculpting to animation and compositing, it’s incredibly full-featured—especially for an open-source platform. That said, getting the hang of it did take some time. The interface can feel dense at first, and based on G2 community feedback, I’m not alone—many new users mention needing a few weeks to feel fully comfortable with its layout and workflow. Still, once the basics click, it becomes second nature.

One area where I think Blender has room to grow is its level of integration with mainstream industry pipelines. Since it’s not a proprietary tool, it’s not always aligned with the software stacks used in studios or large-scale production environments. Verified reviews on G2 echo this—while they love Blender’s capabilities, they point out that it's not yet the standard in industries that rely heavily on tools like Maya or 3ds Max.

That said, for indie creators, students, or anyone looking for a highly flexible platform without the high price tag, Blender remains a top choice. Its open-source nature continues to attract a thriving, supportive community that contributes plugins and updates regularly, which is something I really appreciate.

#### **What I like about Blender:**

- Even though Blender has quite the learning curve, I love how powerful the platform is with its vast toolset for modeling, texturing, animation, video editing, and lighting.
- I love how extensive the rendering engines are and the options that these engines provide when exporting your project. Both Eevee and Cycles offer a lot of variety that you can integrate with projects.
- With how supportive Blender is, I was able to find many resources at my disposal to use to get to know more about techniques the application can provide for me.

#### **What do G2 users like about Blender:**

“I am a big fan of Blender, a 3D software that is both free and open-source. It impresses me with its high-quality tools that are usually found in expensive commercial software. Blender includes features commonly used in the industry, such as modeling, animation, simulation, and rendering which I found super helpful.”

\- [Blender Review](https://www.g2.com/products/blender/reviews/blender-review-9555162), Vaibhav S.

#### **What I dislike about Blender:**

- Despite Blender having a massive community, there is no dedicated customer support. Blender relies on community forums and discussions to help users who may come across an issue. So it was a bit of a “head-scratcher”  for me when I came across technical issues.
- I had a hard time working with the simulation feature’s performance. Since smoke or fluid simulations are complex, they can be intensive on your computer and cause performance lag.

**What do G2 users dislike about Blender:**
“Importing large FBX files is very slow! Although I have a powerful machine (32GB RAM, i7, Nvidia GF 1070) sometimes I wait for more than 10 minutes to import a large FBX file (>1 GB).”

\- [Blender Review](https://www.g2.com/products/blender/reviews/blender-review-8420347), Ziya M.

## 3\. Maya: Best for high-end 3D modeling and animation

[Maya](https://www.g2.com/products/maya/reviews) is an Autodesk 3D modeling software that can be used all-in-one for 3D creations, animation, film, and more. Maya is an industry-standard 3D software application and has been used frequently in the film and animation industry, as well as the gaming industry.

![Maya](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXekK9mrpwxVXuhVOG8Xi2p72coNXGzdQta6vU3cVGZHIS1VCI-PWs17BNshJC6qjskUc6KHbxIW9-b4FaFedYf5dO08BafWJUY0dOlxJTLxCFqqFjVaeHEWvQRtXD_pFZq3YqYf?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

I had the good fortune of being able to use Maya for free since it was offered to students when I took a 3D modeling course. Maya does have an extensive price tag that comes with it, so to justify that price tag Maya offers a lot of fitting features which I greatly enjoyed when exploring this tool.

The reason Maya is so unmatched in most industries is that the app can handle many complex modeling and animation projects, including facial rigs and motion paths. Maya’s polygon and NURBS functionalities, combined with the advanced UV mapping tools, make it an ideal tool for creating realistic models. I also enjoyed Maya’s built-in physics and simulation tools, like Bifrost for fluids and nCloth for cloth dynamics.

Maya continues to impress me with its high-end animation and modeling capabilities, especially when it comes to character rigging and complex simulations. It’s a staple in many professional pipelines, and for good reason. The precision and level of control it offers are exceptional. According to G2 sentiment analysis, Maya’s toolkit is one of the most advanced in the industry, particularly for film and game production.

While I had no trouble navigating its interface, the performance across platforms did vary in my experience. On macOS, it ran smoothly, but when working from my Windows machine at home, the application would sometimes crash mid-project. I found myself frequently saving backups just to avoid losing progress. According to G2 review data, this isn’t uncommon; some users have also mentioned system compatibility as something to watch for, depending on hardware specs and OS.

Another thing worth noting is Maya’s reliance on external plugins. While the core features are robust, there were certain effects I needed that required third-party tools—many of which came at an extra cost. Several G2 users point out the same: while Maya is incredibly capable, achieving its full potential often involves supplementing with paid plugins.

Even with that, I continue to use Maya for projects that demand precision and depth. It’s a tool that grows with you, especially once you know how to tailor it to your workflow.

#### **What I like about Maya:**

- I like Maya’s advanced features and its ability to handle intricate modeling and animation tasks. I found the software particularly useful when creating realistic characters and textures.
- I love that Maya had powerful simulation tools like Bifrost and nCloth, which made environment modeling all the more lifelike.

#### **What do G2 users like about Maya:**

“Best about maya is ease of 3d modeling. With just shift alt and ctrl + mouse buttons you can rule the modeling. Its so easy and fast once you understand the basic. Features like fx and arnold renderer is cherry on the top. Customer support is also too good. If you face any bug or issue with installation the support given is amazing.”

\- [Maya Review](https://www.g2.com/products/maya/reviews/maya-review-9883245), Abhishek S.

#### **What I dislike about Maya:**

- Although the Mac I used in class could handle Maya, working on that same project on my Windows setup at home caused frequent crashes. To not lose progress, I had to back up my work on my external hard drive, which disrupted my workflow and caused a lot of stress.
- I did not like that some projects required me to use a multitude of plugins, which unfortunately some were not free. This drove up my expenses using this app.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Maya:**

“I don't like that some simple operations may turn off or crash, its architecture is already old, unfortunately, but it is still my favorite tool, the customer support sucks.”- [Maya Review](https://www.g2.com/products/maya/reviews/maya-review-9883245), Jorge R.

## 4\. Unity: Best for real-time 3D animation and game development

[Unity](https://www.g2.com/products/unity/reviews) is a popular 3D modeling application for creating video games, animation, and VR/AR content. It’s popular among the gaming industry and is commonly used as the industry-standard game development program. Also known as a game engine, Unity offers real-time tools and cross-platform functionality for artists and designers.

![Unity](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcJ12cACnIR-BlaOtacDbdxaMEinroHaCOXPnBhjF3gwJxiP8Q46o_y8f5BFa832TNVkpihYPpwM8KazRod28KfMHOvYzoSyYhFgW-oI1RfwofFxZtvaipttXMLbMPH7yNetZJB?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

There are many positives to this 3D software. Besides Unity’s cross-platform capabilities, which make it the most versatile engine available, it also has a large asset store of pre-built assets, scripts, tools, and plugins that you can choose from. It was a lifesaver for me when I was looking for certain functionalities I wanted to have for my character’s obstacle course. Another aspect that I love about Unity is that it can integrate with a lot of other software, including Blender, Maya, and Photoshop. Unity is also known for its real-time capabilities. This includes the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) that allowed me to create stunning scenes without compromising my computer’s performance.

Unity has been a go-to platform for me when working on interactive and real-time 3D projects. The engine’s flexibility is unmatched, especially if you're building cross-platform experiences for games, AR/VR, or simulations. What I appreciate most is how accessible it is for developers of all levels—something that many reviewers on G2 have also highlighted. Its large asset store, vast learning ecosystem, and broad device support make it easy to build and iterate quickly.

That said, I’ve noticed that the frequency of updates can sometimes create friction in workflows. In a few cases, I ran into compatibility issues or had to adjust to changes in the API, which made it harder to follow along with existing tutorials or community guides. It’s something verified G2 users bring up fairly often—while Unity’s evolving nature is a strength, it can also be a challenge when it comes to keeping up with version-specific changes.

I also hoped for more out of its visual scripting tools. While Unity Visual Scripting (formerly Bolt) is a welcome addition, it doesn’t yet match the depth or intuitiveness of visual systems in other engines like Unreal’s Blueprints. Insights from G2 reviewers point out that while scripting is accessible, users still lean on code or third-party plugins for more advanced workflows.

Still, Unity continues to be one of the most developer-friendly and scalable tools out there. The ability to bring ideas to life across platforms is what keeps me coming back to it.

#### **What I like about Unity:**

- Normally, the complexity of software is associated with the level of learning you need to know about the app, but I love that Unity offers a lot of tools to turn your 3D models into near-realistic objects.
- I believe Unity has one of the largest and most active communities in the 3D modeling space, which means I have access to a lot of tools and resources that I can use to familiarize myself with the app.

#### **What do G2 users like about Unity:**

“Easy to learn and use, it is excellent for beginners who want to enter the world of video game creation. It offers a multitude of features that guide you through all aspects of game development, including 3D, 2D, lighting, coding, animation, UI, optimization, and more.”

\- [Unity Review](https://www.g2.com/products/unity/reviews/unity-review-1424820), Ernesto S.

#### **What I dislike about Unity:**

- While Unity’s UI system is functional, to me it often feels clunky, especially when some projects require 3rd party plugins to have my models achieve certain results that the original system could not provide.
- After using Unity’s garbage collection system, I noticed performance hitches or frame drops in some of the projects I worked on, especially with projects that had rapid memory allocation.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Unity:**

“Is very overwhelming at first, not gonna lie. Fortunately, there are many step-by-step videos online that ease you into the motion of things. After that, the only thing you need is to select your preferred path and get to it.”

## 5\. Creo Parametric: Best for precision mechanical design

[Creo Parametric](https://www.g2.com/products/creo-parametric/reviews) is PTC’s 3D CAD (computer-aided design) and 3D modeling software and is mainly used to build 3D product designs. The application is used to design, analyze, and share information about products to make it easier for engineers to streamline the product-to-manufacture process.

![Creo Parametric](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc9Ur5ez2WJgMPW5SDvDN0ojxI6XtBf247ay3MeKaexT5pJbfSLsvK6N9KKLIA5Aeg3rJBdEi-sjc5UModzYQKOl9HYIK6xz7kJQI5LI3m0RYvTw0fZfXj-Pkbj8taLkOhxXbvt?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Over the course of a few weeks, I talked to professionals who have used this product and got their take on its pros and cons. I was also given the chance to explore the interface for a little bit. As you can already guess from its name, Creo Parametric **excels in parametric modeling**, a design method in 3D CAD programs that uses parameters and geometric elements when creating a model. Creo Parametric is known to have a pretty sophisticated algorithm to capture information and parameter predictions.

After speaking with a few engineering professionals, I was informed that the Creo Parametric also offers advanced simulation and analysis tools, including thermal structures and motion simulations. I’ve often seen the results from professionals who frequent this app and use the application to create 3D prints. Creo offers built-in tools for designing models for 3D  printing, which is pretty cool.

When I explored its features, I immediately noticed how much depth it offers in terms of simulation, parametric modeling, and manufacturing integration. This level of functionality is exactly why many G2 users consider it a top choice for enterprise teams and product development workflows.

That said, the interface can feel a bit dense at first. With so many tools and options packed into the UI, it can take time to feel fully comfortable navigating it. I found the onboarding experience to be less intuitive compared to other platforms, and feedback on G2 has also pointed out that Creo’s steep learning curve is something to prepare for—especially for those coming from more lightweight or design-focused modeling tools.

Another thing I noticed was the amount of information required just to request a free trial. Rather than offering an instant download, you need to submit a fair amount of personal and company details to access the software, which can add some friction to getting started. As for the cost, it’s definitely on the higher end. Based on notable patterns on G2, this aligns with Creo’s positioning as an enterprise-grade solution rather than a tool for casual or freelance use.

Still, for teams working on complex assemblies and precision engineering, Creo delivers the kind of accuracy and control that’s hard to find elsewhere.

#### **What I like about Creo Parametric:**

- I liked how advanced Creo’s parametric modeling features looked when I explored the tool. I can see why it’s a popular 3D modeling software for product design.
- One of the coolest features I discovered is Creo’s support for 3D printing. It has a lot of built-in tools to make it easy to design models for additive manufacturing and 3D printing.

#### **What do G2 users like about Creo Parametric:**

“Creo Parametric is best for managing large assembly files. It has various features which are pretty easy to use. It is very flexible and customizable. It has very good technical support which enhances the implementation process.”

- [Creo Parametric Review](https://www.g2.com/products/creo-parametric/reviews/creo-parametric-review-9040023), Pavan T.

#### **What I dislike about Creo Parametric:**

- Maybe it’s because I did not want to become a product designer in my timeline, but navigating the interface was overwhelming for me. There were many tools that I didn’t understand and many names of these tools that I was not familiar with, which made understanding the application difficult.
- Getting access to Creo was a bit of a hassle for me. Even getting the free trial, I had to request it on PTC’s site by putting in a lot of personal information.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Creo Parametric:**

“Its very costly as compare to the other CAD Softwares in the market. Apart from Price pont of view. I dont see any disadvantages of using creo. its mostly suitable for solid and sheetmetal modules. They have to improve more on Plastics side of the module.”- [Creo Parametric Review](https://www.g2.com/products/creo-parametric/reviews/creo-parametric-review-7760334), Akshay B.

## 6\. Coohom: Best for interior design and home layouts

[Coohom](https://www.g2.com/products/coohom/reviews) is your leading 3D modeling design software that allows users to create interior designs and floor plans. This affordable interior design platform comes with a free option that offers basic features, which is a great option for those wanting to learn more about designing floor plans without being dedicated to a subscription.

![Coohom](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcyPtpf_O1c1hsCrS1REtoMhu4kY2E-bujCq8WDoeYbxckyqYFaNcXmdGb26IKTx-K2GSox_Qk_SXCaBQql_qcgLoWk43PE7X7UZupfdvBu6Usis1-9ypvf7PfpuYqI6TqnxQ7L?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

When I was in high school, I briefly thought about becoming an architect before I transitioned my aspirations. However, Coohom was not released until 2018, which makes it one of the newest software on this list. I was excited that Coohom offered a free version for me to try this year.What I loved about Coohom’s interface was its user-friendly interface. It offers a drag-and-drop functionality which makes it easy to create interior designs and 3D layouts for beginners. It’s the perfect tool for anyone looking to create visualizations without extensive 3D modeling knowledge. In conjunction with its drag-and-drop functionality, Coohom provides a vast library of pre-built assets, such as furniture and decor, that you can directly add to your designs. If Sims didn’t awaken your desire for interior design, Coohom certainly will.

Coohom made it incredibly easy for me to visualize interior spaces quickly. The drag-and-drop functionality, extensive asset library, and 4K rendering features are great for creating polished room layouts with minimal effort. I found it especially useful for showcasing concepts to clients, and from what I’ve seen on G2 review data, many users appreciate how Coohom speeds up design presentations without requiring deep 3D modeling expertise.

That said, I did find some limitations when I wanted to go beyond what the templates offered. Like many platforms designed for ease of use, customization can be a bit constrained—particularly when working with pre-built assets. A few other verified reviews on G2 mentioned that while the templates look great, making extensive edits to them isn’t always intuitive or flexible.

Coohom is clearly specialized for interior design, which is its strength—but that also means it’s not the best fit for broader 3D modeling or complex architectural projects. If you're aiming to build detailed structures or explore open-ended modeling workflows, you might need a more expansive tool. That said, for interior-focused workflows, especially in residential or commercial space planning, Coohom delivers a streamlined and visually impressive experience.

#### **What I like about Coohom:**

- I like that Coohom offers real-time rendering and can produce high-quality visuals quickly, which makes it ideal for professionals or any user who needs to polish designs in a time crunch.
- Coohom is very easy to use, which makes it quite a timesaver to learn the application quickly if you are looking for an interior design tool to try.

#### **What do G2 users like about Coohom:**

“One of the best aspects of Coohom is its easy-to-use 3D visualization tool, which makes it simple to create realistic room designs. The drag-and-drop feature allows for quick adjustments, and the extensive library of furniture and decor items adds variety. It’s a great tool for getting professional-looking results without needing advanced design skills.”

\- [Coohom Review](https://www.g2.com/products/coohom/reviews/coohom-review-10436527), Munfar A.

#### **What I dislike about Coohom:**

- Although the application is cloud-based, which makes it great to take my project on the go, this could be a double-edged sword at times if you have an unstable internet connection.
- I’ve noticed there were a lot of limitations with other app integrations and it does not integrate well with other 3D modeling or CAD tools.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Coohom:**

“It should start its integration with Revit. As Coohom still lacks in some of the modeling features but making the model in revit and doing rest of the things like material light and rendering or Revit would be great combo.”- [Coohom Review](https://www.g2.com/products/coohom/reviews/coohom-review-6756060), Laiba W.

## 7\. NVIDIA Omniverse: Best for real-time team collaboration

[NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.g2.com/products/nvidia-omniverse/reviews) is an NVIDIA extension app and modular platform that uses advanced APIs, SDKs, and other microservices to build real-time collaborative 3D models. Basically, rather than the app serving as a 3D modeling tool, its focus is built around it being a central hub for designers, artists, and engineers working together on projects in a shared environment.

![NVIDIA Omniverse](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc72Rhp2dQgsvI3656P90O0WfanfwcPPYm_1Tsi1RkfsDATzNVNNQA6OEDC9dX0aa-AkO3h9EJqfehc5JKqm9c_jTRKRRFQlDhlyo3yzA6PhcioU9klK6AIdsunTig1pp9c4LER?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

If you are working on a team project, this application is a great addition to your skillset as it offers real-time collaboration. One of the biggest reasons I love this tool, other than it offering seamless collaboration, is the app is built on Pixar’s Universal Scene Description (USD) framework, which means the app is quite compatible with a variety of industry-standard tools like Maya, 3DS Max, and Unreal Engine. I also like that Omniverse supports AI tools and features like noise reduction and generative modeling.

The platform makes it possible for multiple creators to work on the same project at once—something I found especially valuable when coordinating complex scenes with teammates. G2 users consistently highlight this collaborative functionality as a major strength, especially for enterprise pipelines involving animation, simulation, and design.

That said, the hardware requirements are something to be aware of. As the name suggests, Omniverse is designed to run best with an NVIDIA GPU. When working on a machine without one, I noticed performance wasn't quite as smooth—particularly during rendering and exporting. G2 sentiment analysis also point out that using non-NVIDIA GPUs can lead to a less optimized experience.

In terms of accessibility, the platform feels very much geared toward large studios or enterprise teams. While it offers robust tools for those environments, the cost and infrastructure needs might not make as much sense for freelancers or smaller creative groups. A number of G2 user reviews state this as well—the value is undeniable, but the entry point may be better suited for larger organizations with the resources to support it.

Even so, for studios prioritizing real-time teamwork and advanced simulation, Omniverse is one of the most forward-thinking platforms available.

#### **What I like about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

- If you plan to work with a team on a project, this cloud-based platform is created to streamline communication and productivity across teams that can work on the same project together. Although a bit of a learning curve, I thought this collaboration app was extremely helpful in keeping a project organized.
- I like that NVIDIA’s RTX technology offers ray tracing and AI features. In addition, I liked that Omniverse offers photorealistic rendering in real-time, which was very intuitive.

#### **What do G2 users like about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

“NVIDIA has leveraged its industry dominance in the GPU world, to create a multi-GPU cloud resident platform, which creates photorealistic visuals and clean and connected workflows. The latest integration with Apple Vision Pro is definitely a plus point.”

\- [NVIDIA Omniverse Review](https://www.g2.com/products/nvidia-omniverse/reviews/nvidia-omniverse-review-9905699), Tasneem G.

#### **What I dislike about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

- I do not like that the platform is plugin-dependent and relies on these integrations with external tools, which can lead to compatibility issues or require frequent updates to keep up with its functionality across different teams.
- I dislike how niche-focused this application is, meaning independent or entry-level users might not find the app as useful or a bit of overkill.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about NVIDIA Omniverse:**

“NVIDIA Omniverse has a very complicated initial setup and installation process. It is a hardware-dependent program that needs a high-end GPU to function.”- [NVIDIA Omniverse Review](https://www.g2.com/products/nvidia-omniverse/reviews/nvidia-omniverse-review-9488246), Atharva V.

## 8\. Adobe Dimension: Best for photorealistic 3D product mockups

[Adobe Dimension](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-dimension/reviews) is a 3D design, modeling, and rendering software that focuses on rendering photorealistic 3D images. I’ve seen this application used to build brand visualizations, illustrations, and product mockups. I had fun using this tool for a project to showcase a drink advertisement model.

![Adobe Dimension](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfm7l7ZXgjgjNN8JmtQ5ZR1hFfdpX40kCu91Lwki6trqjtWvBFHsp5JPrr22LtK-j58YdNq6SEntrRofHF-2-VBhmx7g2e6lBS99Udh0B_eJ7O4ij31lbvo4HawkXVbbtoWNQpv4w?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

What I loved most about Adobe Dimension was that it offered a pre-made asset library consisting of a variety of 3D models, materials, lighting setups, and more. I loved that this was one of the applications I used that offered pre-built lighting setups — as I am terrible at setting up the perfect lighting. I love that the tool bridges the gap between 2D and 3D design, which helps aspiring graphic designers create 3D visuals without the need to learn advanced 3D modeling or rendering.

I also have to mention that Dimension has great photorealistic rendering capabilities. I believe Adobe prides itself on this feature alone. Dimension’s ability to simulate realistic lighting and texture makes it a prominent standout feature.

The integration with Creative Cloud makes it especially convenient for designers who already work with Photoshop or Illustrator, and G2 users often point out how seamless that creative handoff feels across Adobe’s ecosystem.

That said, I’ve found that Dimension isn’t really built for creating original 3D models from the ground up. While it does a great job letting you place and render existing 3D assets, it doesn’t offer full modeling functionality. When I wanted more control over object geometry or to tweak pre-built models in detail, I ran into limitations. Based on reviews on G2, this is a common observation—many users enjoy the rendering quality but note that editing capabilities are fairly minimal.

I also noticed the absence of features like ray tracing or native support for engines like V-Ray, which you might expect in more robust 3D software. That said, for packaging visuals, product previews, or marketing materials where fast, attractive rendering is the priority, Adobe Dimension holds up well—especially for those already familiar with Adobe’s creative suite.

#### **What I like about Adobe Dimension:**

- I like how easy Adobe Dimension is to use. Since the application is dependent on pre-built models, it’s easy to set up a stage for my ad project and requires little learning time.
- Since this is an Adobe app, I like that I could integrate this app with other Adobe Creative Cloud applications, like Photoshop.

#### **What do G2 users like about Adobe Dimension:**

“Dimensions bring 3-D mockups and rendering to the hands of graphic designers, I had struggled trying to learn C4D and Blinder in order to bring a 3D mockup or to get product shots to use in posters and social media ads, but dimensions made that very easy, you don't have to worry about texture and lighting and render sitting, you just choose what suits you off the list and there it is ready for you

\- [Adobe Dimension Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-dimension/reviews/adobe-dimension-review-8535460), Mohammad K.

#### **What I dislike about Adobe Dimension:**

- Just like all Adobe apps, I do not like subscription-based applications, and Adobe Dimension can be a bit expensive for occasional users, like myself.
- I dislike the 3D modeling limitations of this app. Dimension focused on product visualization and setting up a stage for brand and marketing, so it wasn’t as suitable for someone like me who wanted to use the tool for animation and game design.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Adobe Dimension:**

“The downsides are mostly around pricing, but for professionals, this is just a small cost per month that is fully deductible, unlike an outright purchase. Another negative, though less visible, is the number of "helpers" that run in the background and the need for an always-on internet connection.”- [Adobe Dimension Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-creative-cloud/reviews/adobe-creative-cloud-review-8615706), Daniel M.

## 9\. Recap: Best for converting real-world data to 3D models

[ReCap](https://www.g2.com/products/recap/reviews), short for “Reality Capture,” is an Autodesk platform used for 3D scanning and 2D drawing. It captures photos or scans and turns them into detailed 3D models. This application is mainly used by those interested in architecture or engineering. Many surveyors also use it to create terrain maps and land surveys.

![ReCap](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXep3Sij6bC0cehHKeoYHEASoZQiwZwO3O_rgHHZde9GBP-hZuocuiEvk39xYaPIV8MlSHSfvpSEvOqHX_1bPUg6W_LWlQoSBPw8mR7ecHvHEpTDb96PHQRvDSrjuWrSK1Dhuh3BeQ?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

I briefly experimented with this application. For this article, I did do a few weeks of research with the use of the 30-day free trial offered by Autodesk.What I like most about the ReCap app is how effective it was at accurately capturing scans or photos that I imported from the tool. It was impressive that it was able to turn pictures of real-life architecture from multiple angles and create a 3D model of that architecture. ReCap supports multiple integrations, such as AutoCAD, Revit, and Navisworks. It also supports a wide range of input data, including LiDAR scans, drone mapping, 2D images, and land surveys, making this tool incredibly versatile. Another feature I liked is that ReCap offers RealView Navigation, which allows users to navigate the 3D models as if they’re walking through that space.

ReCap has been incredibly useful when it comes to converting real-world scans into accurate 3D models. I found it especially helpful for site surveys and capturing architectural environments in detail. According to several G2 reviewers, ReCap’s strength lies in its precision and automation—it streamlines the reality capture process and integrates well with other Autodesk products for construction and design.

However, I did find that its editing capabilities are fairly limited. While it’s excellent at processing point clouds and photogrammetry data, making detailed changes to those models often required me to export the file and refine it in another application. From what I’ve seen on G2, others have echoed this point—ReCap serves as a solid first step in the workflow, but isn't a one-stop solution for full 3D editing.

I also noticed that integration with non-Autodesk tools felt somewhat restricted. The software is clearly optimized for users already in the Autodesk ecosystem, which makes sense, but it did limit my flexibility when I wanted to incorporate it into different pipelines. Exporting options were also more limited in the free version, which is something G2 users frequently point out as a factor to consider when evaluating which license tier to choose.

Still, for accurately capturing and processing real-world environments, ReCap is a strong choice—especially if you're already working within Autodesk’s suite of tools.

#### **What I like about ReCap:**

- What impressed me about this app was how accurately it was able to capture scans and photos I imported and take those photos and create navigational 3D models completed from every angle.
- I also liked how this application supports many data types, from LiDAR scans and drone maps to 2D images and land surveys. It made options nearly limitless.

#### **What do G2 users like about ReCap:**

“Recap serves primarily to transform photographs into point clouds, which can be effectively utilized in Building Information Modeling (BIM). This software proves highly advantageous to BIM engineers, significantly assisting in the process of 3D modeling within Revit.”

\- [ReCap Review](https://www.g2.com/products/recap/reviews/recap-review-8266996), Kishore K.

#### **What I dislike about ReCap:**

- While I do think this application is cool, it does lack advanced tools for detailed modifications, and in some cases for me to tweak the model, I had to make these modifications in tools like AutoCAD and resubmitting that scan in ReCap.
- I did not like that the software was confined to Autodesk applications and the restrictive options for exporting the final product, especially in the free or basic version.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about ReCap:**

“The user interface of this software is a bit tricky to use. This software do not have many options to customise the feature that are being used on daily basis us.”- [ReCap Review](https://www.g2.com/products/recap/reviews/recap-review-7505966), Devendra S.

## 10\. Adobe Substance: Best for creating realistic textures

[Adobe Substance 3D Sampler](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-substance-3d-sampler/reviews) is an extension app for Adobe’s Substance 3D tool and is used to design, create, and edit realistic materials and textures for 3D models. It’s a 3D scanning software that uses AI to create high-quality 3D materials. Many users, especially those using other Adobe applications will use this tool to help create additional attributes to add to their 3D models. This application is mainly used to create hyper-realistic materials that can be integrated into larger 3D models.

![Adobe Substance 3D Sampler](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfLD-SuuknWBGZ2uacT9EZ2CNmq6WflxY4vezm33c4gaCMbYjaO6RjBJrqVrtaE_IvA1p6WRL-sD9hfSx60gc_4FEHB-qAu3z2sbbV2oywjd4hnQDYogO6eAk17Gz4n0jdm3bET?key=9EOUSTadihH8W4s4meS8KMTZ)

Some features that I love about this application include its AI-powered material feature and the beginner-friendly UI. The app uses Adobe Sensei AI to assist in converting photos and scans into high-quality tileable 3D materials. In addition, the interface is also easy to use with its clean and innovative workflow. Both of these features help save time and effort for designers or users wanting quick results.

The tool also generates materials with PBR (Physically Based Rendering) maps, such as base colors and roughness of a texture.  This means that the application can render my projects with simulated light that naturally interacts with materials in the real world, so I don’t have to edit the light source myself.

Substance 3D Sampler has been a game-changer for me when it comes to creating highly realistic textures. I love how easily it turns real-world images into PBR materials, and the AI-powered enhancement tools help streamline what would otherwise be a time-intensive process. Many creators on G2 also mention how the app simplifies material generation while maintaining an impressive level of detail.

That said, I did notice that the application can be quite demanding on hardware—especially when processing high-resolution textures or working on large-scale projects. In my experience, things slowed down significantly when the scene became more complex, and G2 reviewers have noted similar issues with lag or occasional crashes, particularly on mid-range machines.

Another thing to be mindful of is that the output quality is heavily dependent on the source images. When I fed in lower-quality or slightly blurry photos, the resulting materials needed a lot of cleanup. This aligns with what others on G2 have said: the better your input, the better the outcome. It’s definitely worth curating high-quality source material if you want consistent, professional results.

Still, for creating photorealistic textures with minimal manual effort, Substance 3D Sampler offers a powerful and time-saving workflow—especially if you pair it with other tools in Adobe’s Substance suite.

#### **What I like about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

- One feature I absolutely love is the PBR map generation feature, which mimics real-world material behavior under lighting, so I don’t have the edit the lights and shadows of an object, myself. This saves me a ton of time!
- The UI is very clean and direct, making the app incredibly easy to navigate, even for a beginner like myself. Its creative workflow allows me to focus more on creativity and less on trying to figure out how the tool works.

#### **What do G2 users like about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

“It's good for the Texturing and working on the real based Texturing and very nice output for the any working like movie and gaming and product because it's work on the real based tendering.”

\- [Adobe Substance 3D Sampler Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-substance-3d-sampler/reviews/adobe-substance-3d-sampler-review-7262971), Yash A.

#### **What I dislike about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

- I dislike how resource-heavy the app is. It’s a real resource hog for processing high-res texture and working on larger projects. I’ve experienced multiple lags and occasional crashes at the time.
- I wish the application was an all-in-one software, however, it’s niche-focused and only specializes in texture creation, which it is great at, but I feel like the app would be more versatile if it offered more 3D modeling functionalities, like mesh creation and sculpting.

#### **What do G2 users dislike about Adobe Substance 3D Sampler:**

“It is still like a few more tools that are specific to textiles and fashion. Transparency can be really important, so if there was a way to pick out areas of transparency to make the alpha map would be great. In fact, if there were more tools to actually create maps for specific areas of the fabric would be great. In Style3D fabric, for example, I can use an eye dropper tool or paintbrush to define specific areas of metalness or transparency. This is helpful for fabrics that are not evenly metallic or all one opaqueness.”- [Adobe Substance 3D Sampler Review](https://www.g2.com/products/adobe-substance-3d-sampler/reviews/adobe-substance-3d-sampler-review-8175465), Joneien J.

# Dust3D Free Open Source 3D Modeler

Free, Open-Source, and Intuitive 3D Modeling tool for all your 3D Modeling needs.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b03158_5d5ea80020d64b659dcaa77935b80986~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_49,h_38,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/b03158_5d5ea80020d64b659dcaa77935b80986~mv2.png)

Creating custom 3D models for your games can breathe the personalized charm into your Games in an instant but unfortunately, that isn’t the way for some Indie Developers who are starting out or don’t have enough time to create their own 3D models from scratch and they often go the route of buying 3D models from the marketplaces. Whether you are a beginner or a professional, an easy to access and intuitive 3D modeling software can provide a lot of creative freedom for both concepting and final modeling. But learning a full-fledged 3D software suite for smaller tasks is a headache if rushed through during the learning phase.

Dust3D is a new entrant in the market that offers intuitive tools and fast workflow for speeding through the modeling process, cutting down the modeling times and complexity while providing tools for all sorts of modeling paradigms like UV Unwrapping, Rigging, Pose and Motion Authoring and more. The icing on the cake? They are an Epic MegaGrants recipient, so expect great things to come from the developers in the future. Also, the program is cross-platform, so no matter what OS you use (Windows, macOS, or Linux), they’ve got you covered with the same experience while using it.

[![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b03158_520103b585864c40a260a08533b98478~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_49,h_28,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/b03158_520103b585864c40a260a08533b98478~mv2.png)](https://dust3d.org/)

The modeling approach is quite unique with a node-based modeling workflow in which you create nodes instead of polygons and the nodes are meshed and skinned accordingly to make a 3D Model. You’ve got to try it out to understand its potential as a great concepting tool.

> As they quote on their website, “With Dust3D, you'll see yourself finish a game asset in a blink! Dust3D also supports export your model as FBX and glTF format, so that you can then import the files into softwares like Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot for further development.”

# Roblox releases its open source model that can create 3D objects using AI

[Lauren Forristal](https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/)

6:30 AM PDT · March 17, 2025

Roblox [announced](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/03/introducing-roblox-cube) Monday that it’s launching the first iteration of its 3D model, dubbed “Cube,” to allow creators to create 3D objects using generative AI. The company also launched an open source version so anyone off the platform can build on it.

Announced last year at Roblox’s [annual developer conference](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/roblox-introduces-new-earning-opportunities-for-creators-teases-generative-ai-project/), the company is demoing Cube at the Game Developers Conference ( [GDC](https://gdconf.com/)) later this afternoon.

Creators will have access to Cube later this week, which includes its first tool: mesh generation.

Cube’s 3D mesh generation, currently available in beta, enables creators to “meshes,” or 3D representations of objects, using a single prompt. For instance, “generate an orange racing car with black stripes.” Creators can further adjust the in-game item within Roblox Studio.

The open source version of Cube 3D allows anyone to customize, create plug-ins, or train the model with their own datasets to fit their needs.

Roblox also announced three additional AI tools — text generation, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. These capabilities will launch in the coming months.

The text generation tool lets developers add text-based AI features to their games. This includes giving players the option of having conversations with interactive non-player characters (NPCs).

Text-to-speech, meanwhile, lets developers add narration, have NPCs speak, or include spoken captions in their games. Speech-to-text allows players to use voice commands, like directing characters to move forward.

Other future plans the company has include launching mesh generation for more “complex” objects and scene generation, Roblox explains. The scene generation tool, for instance, will allow creators to prompt the AI to make a full forest scene and change the green leaves on trees to fall colors to show the season changing.

As Roblox previously stated last year, the long-term goal is to have the 3D objects and scenes fully functional, which it calls “4D creation.”

“Where the fourth dimension is interaction between objects, environments, and people,” Nick Tornow, vice president of engineering at Roblox, told TechCrunch.

As with any company exploring generative AI tools, Roblox believes Cube will help creators work faster, allowing indie developers to take on bigger projects. The company has already released several AI tools, including for [texture generation and avatar creation](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/robloxs-ai-features-create-avatars-3d-models/).

AI tools in gaming are a hot topic, with several companies making advancements in the space. Most recently, Tencent launched its open source [3D generation model](https://3d-models.hunyuan.tencent.com/), designed to generate 3D models through text prompts or 2D images.

However, the use of AI continues to raise concerns within the industry. As indicated in [GDC’s recent report](https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more), 30% of game developers feel that generative AI is negatively affecting the gaming space. According to a [CVL Economics study](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ce331b47a39b9000198fffa/t/65b9314fd6198f70b0ec7402/1706635612414/Future+Unscripted+-+The+Impact+of+Generative+Artificial+Intelligence+on+Entertainment+Industry+Jobs+-+pages_compressed.pdf), it’s projected that 13.4% of gaming jobs could be impacted or replaced by AI by 2026.
