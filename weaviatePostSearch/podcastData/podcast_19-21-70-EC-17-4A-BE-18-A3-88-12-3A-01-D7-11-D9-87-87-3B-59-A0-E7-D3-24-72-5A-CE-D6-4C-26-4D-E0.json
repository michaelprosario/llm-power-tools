    "Description": "<p>Dr. Joscha Bach introduces a surprising idea called &quot;cyber animism&quot; in his AGI-24 talk - the notion that nature might be full of self-organizing software agents, similar to the spirits in ancient belief systems. Bach suggests that consciousness could be a kind of software running on our brains, and wonders if similar &quot;programs&quot; might exist in plants or even entire ecosystems. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>MLST is sponsored by Brave:</p>\n<p>The Brave Search API covers over 20 billion webpages, built from scratch without Big Tech biases or the recent extortionate price hikes on search API access.

Joscha believes we should blur the lines between human, artificial, and natural intelligence, and argues that consciousness might be more widespread and interconnected than we ever thought possible.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Dr. Joscha Bach</p>\n<p>https://x.com/Plinz</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This is video 2/9 from our coverage of AGI-24 in Seattle https://agi-conf.org/2024/ </p>\n<p>Watch the official MLST interview with Joscha which we did right after this talk on our Patreon now on early access - https://www.patreon.com/posts/joscha-bach-110199676 (you also get access to our private discord and biweekly calls)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>00:00:00 Introduction: AGI and Cyberanimism</p>\n<p>00:03:57 The Nature of Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:08:46 Aristotle&#39;s Concepts of Mind and Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:13:23 The Hard Problem of Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:16:17 Functional Definition of Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:20:24 Comparing LLMs and Human Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:26:52 Testing for Consciousness in AI Systems</p>\n<p>00:30:00 Animism and Software Agents in Nature</p>\n<p>00:37:02 Plant Consciousness and Ecosystem Intelligence</p>\n<p>00:40:36 The California Institute for Machine Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:44:52 Ethics of Conscious AI and Suffering</p>\n<p>00:46:29 Philosophical Perspectives on Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:49:55 Q&amp;A: Formalisms for Conscious Systems</p>\n<p>00:53:27 Coherence, Self-Organization, and Compute Resources</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>YT version (very high quality, filmed by us live)</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/34VOI_oo-qM</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Refs:</p>\n<p>Aristotle&#39;s work on the soul and consciousness</p>\n<p>Richard Dawkins&#39; work on genes and evolution</p>\n<p>Gerald Edelman&#39;s concept of Neural Darwinism</p>\n<p>Thomas Metzinger&#39;s book &quot;Being No One&quot;</p>\n<p>Yoshua Bengio&#39;s concept of the &quot;consciousness prior&quot;</p>\n<p>Stuart Hameroff&#39;s theories on microtubules and consciousness</p>\n<p>Christof Koch&#39;s work on consciousness</p>\n<p>Daniel Dennett&#39;s &quot;Cartesian Theater&quot; concept</p>\n<p>Giulio Tononi&#39;s Integrated Information Theory</p>\n<p>Mike Levin&#39;s work on organismal intelligence</p>\n<p>The concept of animism in various cultures</p>\n<p>Freud&#39;s model of the mind</p>\n<p>Buddhist perspectives on consciousness and meditation</p>\n<p>The Genesis creation narrative (for its metaphorical interpretation)</p>\n<p>California Institute for Machine Consciousness</p>\n",
