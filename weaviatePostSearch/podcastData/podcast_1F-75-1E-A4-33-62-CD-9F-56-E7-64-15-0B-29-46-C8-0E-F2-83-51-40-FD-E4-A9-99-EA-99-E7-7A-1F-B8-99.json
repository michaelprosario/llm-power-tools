    "Description": "<p>Dr. Marc Isseks, author of Captivate: Engaging and Empowering Students in a World of Digital Distractions, talks bluntly about cell phone policies and his opinion that attempting to ban cell phones is pointless. He also discusses the ways that you can engage students who have a short attention span (sometimes it feels like zero, but there are a few seconds -- 3 seconds. Some would say that is zero!)</p> <p>His thoughts on starting class are important ones to discuss. Whether it is pop culture, or other tips he offers, we can engage students in learning from the moment they walk in the door.</p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e877\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e877</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
