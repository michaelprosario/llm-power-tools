    "Description": "<p>Daron Franklin also known as \u201cCoach Frank,\u201d is a former Algebra I teacher turned human performance coach. His practical advice to help teachers reach kids and to help kids reach their goals is spot on. He talks about strategies for improving student motivation.</p> <p id=\"block-8bba93b8-645b-45f6-8b58-197151aced50\" class= \"block-editor-rich-text__editable block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected wp-block-paragraph rich-text\" role=\"document\" contenteditable=\"true\" aria-multiline=\"true\" aria-label=\"Block: Paragraph\" data-block= \"8bba93b8-645b-45f6-8b58-197151aced50\" data-type=\"core/paragraph\" data-title=\"Paragraph\" data-empty=\"false\" data-wp-block-attribute-key=\"content\">Additionally, he shares the importance of building relationships and things you can say and do to support student mental health. I like how he encourages us teachers to be honest when we make mistakes (we all make them.) He also encourages us to bring relevance into every lesson. Finally, his encouragement to develop keystone habits is something we can all do.</p> <p class= \"block-editor-rich-text__editable block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected wp-block-paragraph rich-text\" role=\"document\" contenteditable=\"true\" aria-multiline=\"true\" aria-label=\"Block: Paragraph\" data-block= \"8bba93b8-645b-45f6-8b58-197151aced50\" data-type=\"core/paragraph\" data-title=\"Paragraph\" data-empty=\"false\" data-wp-block-attribute-key=\"content\">Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e888\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e888</a></p> <p class= \"block-editor-rich-text__editable block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected wp-block-paragraph rich-text\" role=\"document\" contenteditable=\"true\" aria-multiline=\"true\" aria-label=\"Block: Paragraph\" data-block= \"8bba93b8-645b-45f6-8b58-197151aced50\" data-type=\"core/paragraph\" data-title=\"Paragraph\" data-empty=\"false\" data-wp-block-attribute-key=\"content\">Download the infographic and read Coach Frank's bio on the show notes page.</p>",
