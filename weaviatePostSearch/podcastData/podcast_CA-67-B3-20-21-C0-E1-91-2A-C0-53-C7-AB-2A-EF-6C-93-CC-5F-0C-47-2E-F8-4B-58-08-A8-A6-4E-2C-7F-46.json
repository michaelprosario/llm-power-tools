    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lethain\">Will Larson</a> CTO @ Calm shares with us how to focus your time on what actually matters. You\u2019ll hear about many of the common traps engineering leaders fall into and his frameworks to help you better target your time to focus on long-term, high-impact work.</p><p><i>\"A lot of times they'll be like, 'Oh no one's working on this... I can make a huge improvement here!' But then they'll get signals from leadership that 'Actually this isn't valued...' And so I think it's really important to understand what SHOULD be valuable, and then understand what IS actually valued, and then make your own decisions based on that in terms of where you want to put your time.\"</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>WILL LARSON, CTO @ CALM</strong></p><p>Will previously working at places like Stripe, Uber, and Digg.
