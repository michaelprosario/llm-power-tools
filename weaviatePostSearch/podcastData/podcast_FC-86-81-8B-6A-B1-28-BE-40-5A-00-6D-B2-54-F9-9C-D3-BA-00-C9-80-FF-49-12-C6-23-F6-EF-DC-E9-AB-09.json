    "Description": "Amy Simmons spent six years working as a journalist at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC of Australia. As an online journalism, she thought it was a good idea to learn how to code and use that to tell her stories in a new way. So with ABC\u2019s support, she enrolled in a bootcamp, only to find out half way through that she no longer wanted to do journalism at all. Amy tells us how she made the leap into full-time developer and how she found her job as a .NET and C# programmer. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
