    "Description": "\n        <p>Mrs. Meyer\u2019s is a hugely successful line of soaps and cleansers named for a real Mrs. Meyer: a no-nonsense Iowa homemaker who raised nine kids, including the brand\u2019s founder. When Monica Nassif started Mrs. Meyer\u2019s, she\u2019d already launched an upscale cleaning brand, but it was too pricey for the mass market.&nbsp;Worried that another company might muscle into her lane,&nbsp;Monica decided to knock herself off: she launched Mrs. Meyer\u2019s with an elegant design and exotic fragrances\u2013 but at a price point that allowed her to target Target. Monica\u2019s mom Thelma became a beloved mascot for the brand, which\u2013after spreading to sinks across America \u2014 was eventually acquired by S.C.
