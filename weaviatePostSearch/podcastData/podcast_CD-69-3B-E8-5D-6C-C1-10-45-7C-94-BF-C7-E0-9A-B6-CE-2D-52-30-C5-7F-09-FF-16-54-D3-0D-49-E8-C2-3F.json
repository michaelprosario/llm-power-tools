    "Description": "<p>The Linux xz utils backdoor exploit, discussed in an interview at the Open Source Summit 2024 on The New Stack Makers with John Kjell, director of open source at TestifySec, highlights critical vulnerabilities in the open-source ecosystem. This exploit involved a maintainer of the Linux xz utils project adding malicious code to a new release, discovered by a Microsoft engineer. This breach demonstrates the high trust placed in maintainers and how this trust can be exploited. Kjell explains that the backdoor allowed remote code execution or unauthorized server access through SSH connections.</p><p>The exploit reveals a significant flaw: the human element in open source. Maintainers, often under pressure from company executives to quickly address vulnerabilities and updates, can become targets for social engineering. Attackers built trust within the community by contributing to projects over time, eventually gaining maintainer status and inserting malicious code. This scenario underscores the economic pressures on open source, where maintainers work unpaid and face demands from large organizations, exposing the fragility of the open-source supply chain. Despite these challenges, the community's resilience is also evident in their rapid response to such threats.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Linux xz utils\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/linux-xz-backdoor-damage-could-be-greater-than-feared/\">Linux xz Backdoor Damage Could Be Greater Than Feared\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/unzipping-the-xz-backdoor-and-its-lessons-for-open-source/\">Unzipping the XZ Backdoor and Its Lessons for Open Source\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-linux-xz-backdoor-episode-an-open-source-mystery/\">The Linux xz Backdoor Episode: An Open Source Myster\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><h1>\u00a0</h1><h1>\u00a0</h1><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
