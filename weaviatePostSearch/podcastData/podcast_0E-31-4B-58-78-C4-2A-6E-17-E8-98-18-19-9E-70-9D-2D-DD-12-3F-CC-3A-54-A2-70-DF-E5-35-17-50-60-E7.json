    "Description": "<p>What's your adaptability quotient? Richard chats with Sara Caldwell and Angela Dugan about the ideas behind the adaptability quotient - the ability to respond to change. The pandemic certainly forced a lot of change on a lot of folks - and different people coped with the changes in different ways. Sara talks about thinking about your ability to adapt and strengthening that ability, starting with asking for help where needed. Angela digs into the changes that have happened for her and Sara just recently with the acquisition of their company - more opportunities to adapt! Change is inevitable. It's just a question of what we keep from the past and what we let go of: How are you adapting?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.polarissolutions.com/blog/adaptability-quotient\">Adaptability Quotient</a></li><li><a href=\"https://miro.com/\">Miro</a></li><li><a href=\"https://3cloudsolutions.com/\">3 Cloud Solutions</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 25, 2021</p>\n",
