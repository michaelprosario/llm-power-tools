    "Description": "<p>At Arm, open source is the default approach, with proprietary software requiring justification, says Andrew Wafaa, fellow and senior director of software communities. Speaking at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, Wafaa emphasized Arm\u2019s decade-long commitment to open source, highlighting its investment in key projects like the Linux kernel, GCC, and LLVM. This investment is strategic, ensuring strong support for Arm\u2019s architecture through vital tools and system software.</p><p>Wafaa also challenged the hype around GPUs in AI, asserting that CPUs\u2014especially those enhanced with Arm\u2019s Scalable Matrix Extension (SME2) and Scalable Vector Extension (SVE2)\u2014are often more suitable for inference workloads. CPUs offer greater flexibility, and Arm\u2019s innovations aim to reduce dependency on expensive GPU fleets.</p><p>On the AI framework front, Wafaa pointed to PyTorch as the emerging hub, likening its ecosystem-building potential to Kubernetes. As a PyTorch Foundation board member, he sees PyTorch becoming the central open source platform in AI development, with broad community and industry backing.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights about Arm:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/edge-wars-heat-up-as-arm-aims-to-outflank-intel-qualcomm/\">Edge Wars Heat Up as Arm Aims to Outflank Intel, Qualcomm\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/arm-see-a-demo-about-migrating-a-x86-based-app-to-arm64/\">Arm: See a Demo About Migrating a x86-Based App to ARM64</a></p><p><br /><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
