    "Description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telecoms are not necessarily associated with adopting new-generation technologies. However, Deutsche Telekom has made considerable investments cloud in native environments, by creating and supporting Kubernetes clusters to supports its operations infrastructure.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode of</span><a href=\"/tag/the-new-stack-makers\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Stack Makers podcast</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, recorded on the floor of</span><a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps engineers </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-dziomba-5a9220153/?originalSubdomain=de\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Dziomba</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-nitsche-457ba3158/?locale=en_US\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samy Nitsche</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0of </span><a href=\"https://www.telekom.com/en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deutsche Telekom</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> discuss how one of Europe\u2019s largest telecom providers made the shift to cloud native.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deutsche Telekom obviously didn\u2019t start from scratch. It had decades worth of telecom infrastructure and networks that all needed to be integrated into the new world of Kubenetes. This involved a lot of \u201cdiscussion with the other teams,\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dziomba said. \u201cWe had to work together [with other departments] to see how we wanted to manage legacy integration, and especially, and especially, policy and process integration,\u201d Dziomba said.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it turned out, many of the existing services Deutsche Telekom offered were conductive to integrating into the distributed Kubernetes infrastructure. \u201cIt was suited to be deployed on something like Kubernetes,\u201d Dziomba said. \u201cThe decision was also made to build the Kubernetes platform by ourselves inside Deutsche Telekom and not to buy one. This really \u00a0facilitated the move towards cloud native infrastructure.\u201d</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift also heavily involved the vendors that were \u201ccoming from the old route,\u201d \u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nitsche said. \u201cIt's sometimes a challenge to make sure that the application is really also cloud native and to make sure it can use all the benefits Kubernetes offers.</span></p>\n",
