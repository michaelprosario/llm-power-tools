    "Description": "<p>What are the new ways we can teach and share our knowledge about Python? How can we improve the structure of our current offerings and build new educational resources for our audience of Python learners? This week on the show, Real Python core team members Stephen Gruppetta and Martin Breuss join us to discuss enhancements to the site and new ways to learn Python.</p>\n<p>Stephen has recently joined the team, bringing years of online training expertise. He discusses our new offering of <a href=\"https://realpython.com/workshops/intermediate-deep-dive/\">cohort-based courses</a>, which combine live expert instruction, hands-on exercises, and a supportive community.</p>\n<p>Martin has been busy leading the effort to create quizzes for our written tutorials to test your knowledge and Python skills. He&rsquo;s also restructuring the learning paths to provide a more consistent way to navigate your journey learning Python.</p>\n<p>Stephen is currently working on new Real Python books. These books will be collections of our tutorials based on specific Python topics and edited to provide a more structured learning experience. The first book, which covers object-oriented programming in Python, will be available in the next few months.</p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Sentry.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/handling-preventing-errors-lbyl-eafp/\">Handling or Preventing Errors in Python: LBYL vs EAFP</a></p>\n<p>In this video course, you&rsquo;ll explore two popular coding styles in Python: Look Before You Leap (LBYL) and Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP). These approaches help you handle errors and exceptional situations in your code effectively. You&rsquo;ll dive into the key differences between LBYL and EAFP and learn when to use each one.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:02:29 &ndash; What Stephen has been up to</li>\n<li>00:03:31 &ndash; What&rsquo;s new for Martin</li>\n<li>00:04:07 &ndash; Bringing on new team members</li>\n<li>00:06:09 &ndash; Cohort-based courses</li>\n<li>00:19:25 &ndash; Sponsor: Sentry</li>\n<li>00:20:27 &ndash; Restructured and new learning paths</li>\n<li>00:30:50 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:32:19 &ndash; New Real Python Books</li>\n<li>00:38:57 &ndash; A destination for learning</li>\n<li>00:40:46 &ndash; Quizzes for tutorials and courses </li>\n<li>00:44:58 &ndash; Video courses and updating content</li>\n<li>00:47:52 &ndash; Code Mentor</li>\n<li>00:49:45 &ndash; Code challenges   </li>\n<li>00:51:06 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/workshops/intermediate-deep-dive/\">Cohort Course - Intermediate Python Deep Dive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/learning-paths/\">Python Learning Paths</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/products/books/\">Python Books by Real Python</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/quizzes/\">Python Quizzes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/community/\">Join the Real Python Community Chat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/mentor/\">Code Mentor: Intelligent Learning Tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/office-hours/\">Office Hours \u2013 Real Python</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.sentry.io/debugging-python-with-vs-code-and-sentry/\">Debugging Python with VS Code and Sentry - Product Blog - Sentry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/team/mbreuss/\">About Martin Breuss \u2013 Real Python</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/team/sgruppetta/\">About Stephen Gruppetta \u2013 Real Python</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Level up your Python skills with our expert-led courses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/handling-preventing-errors-lbyl-eafp/\">Handling or Preventing Errors in Python: LBYL vs EAFP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/using-raise-for-effective-exceptions/\">Using raise for Effective Exceptions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-basics-exercises-scopes/\">Python Basics Exercises: Scopes</a></li>\n</ul> <p><a rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://realpython.com/join\">Support the podcast &amp; join our community of Pythonistas</a></p>",
