    "Description": "<p>Happy Hour of Code Week. Here are your ideas to get started. Brian Aspinall, author of Code Breaker: 15+ Ways to Get Started with Coding, shares how students from kindergarten to high school can start to learn coding. He also discusses why the argument that every child won't become a coder just doesn't hold water. Enjoy Hour of Code week!</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e396\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e396</a></p> <p>SPONSOR: Join a Free Personalized Learning Session with Me and TextHelp! This Thursday, December 6 from 1-3 pm Eastern Time, Edweek is hosting an event about personalized learning. I'll be co-hosting a panel conversation on how I help kids learn how to personalize their own learning, how we can differentiate instruction, and we'll have an \"old fashioned\" tool share at 2 pm in the room. Even if you cannot attend live, you can sign up to review the links and transcripts later. Get ready to talk about Personalized Learning. Just go to <a href= \"https://text.help/coolcatteacher\">text.help/coolcatteacher</a> and join the conversation.</p>",
