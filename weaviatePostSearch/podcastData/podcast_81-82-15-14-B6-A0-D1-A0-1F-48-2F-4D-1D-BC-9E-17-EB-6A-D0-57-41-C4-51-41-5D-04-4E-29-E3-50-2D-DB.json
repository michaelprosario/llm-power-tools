    "Description": "<p>In this episode of<i>The New Stack Makers</i>, Nitric CEO Steve Demchuk discusses how the frustration of building frontend apps within rigid FinTech environments led to the creation of the Nitric framework \u2014 a tool designed to eliminate the friction between developers and cloud infrastructure. Unlike traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC), where developers must manage both app logic and infrastructure definitions separately, Nitric introduces \u201cInfrastructure from Code.\u201d This approach allows developers to focus solely on application logic while the platform infers and automates infrastructure needs using SDKs and CLI tools across multiple languages and cloud providers.</p><p>Demchuk emphasizes that Nitric doesn't remove platform team control but enforces it consistently. Guardrails defined by platform teams guide infrastructure provisioning, ensuring security and compliance \u2014 even as developers use AI tools to rapidly generate code. The result is a streamlined workflow where developers move faster, AI enhances productivity, and platform teams retain oversight. This episode offers engineering leaders insight into a paradigm shift in how cloud infrastructure is managed in the AI era.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights about Nitric:\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/building-a-serverless-meme-generator-with-nitric-and-openai/ \">Building a Serverless Meme Generator With Nitric and OpenAI</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/why-most-companies-are-struggling-with-infrastructure-as-code/ \">Why Most Companies Are Struggling With Infrastructure as Code</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a>Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
