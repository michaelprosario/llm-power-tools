    "Description": "<p>When Michelle Wahler and Jodi Guber Brufsky set out to launch a yoga wear brand in 2005, they had no idea that it would eventually be acquired\u2014for hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014by one of the most iconic apparel brands in the world.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>But it took years for Beyond Yoga to get to that point. It grew slowly by partnering with yoga studios and mom-and-pop boutiques, and apart from some initial seed money, it never took on any outside investment. With an obsessive focus on soft fabrics, inclusive sizing and U.S.-based manufacturing, Beyond Yoga eventually began competing with more established brands like Lululemon and Athleta. And in 2021, the brand was acquired by Levi\u2019s for $400 million.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
