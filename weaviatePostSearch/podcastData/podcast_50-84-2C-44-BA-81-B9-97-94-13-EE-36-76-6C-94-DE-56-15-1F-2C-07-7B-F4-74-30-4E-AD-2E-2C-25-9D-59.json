    "Description": "<p>Born and raised in China, Liam arrived in the US to attend the University of California at Berkeley, where he studied <a href=\"https://hci.berkeley.edu/\">human-computer interaction</a>. After some initial \u201cculture shock\u201d at the differences between his education in China and the \u201copen and innovative\u201d Berkeley environment, Liam thrived. After graduating, he worked at LinkedIn before returning to China to found a startup called <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/zaihui/\">Zaihui</a>, offering ecommerce SaaS solutions for retailers.</p><p>Liam describes the still-commonplace <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/996-work-culture-schedule-popular-in-china-explained-2021-7\">9-9-6 schedule</a> (working from nine in the morning until nine at night, six days a week) and the approach of assigning multiple teams to compete on different visions for the same product.</p><p>In Liam\u2019s view, US and Chinese engineering teams take different approaches to work, work-life balance, innovation, and risk. US teams pursue \u201cbreakthrough innovations\u201d that impress customers, while \u201chustling and hardworking\u201d Chinese teams \u201cwant to <a href=\"https://www.jontaplin.com/move-fast-and-break-things\">move fast and break things</a>\u201d to copy what works and make it incrementally better.\u00a0</p><p>What would a hybrid of these approaches look like? Liam\u2019s new startup, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/immersive-inc/\">Immersive</a>, is combining teams from the US and China to find out.</p><p>Follow Liam on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamyz/\">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>Today\u2019s <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/8842/lifeboat\">Lifeboat badge</a> goes to user <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/977038/abhijit\">Abhijit</a> for their answer to the question <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30986751/set-difference-versus-set-subtraction\">Set difference versus set subtraction</a>.</p>\n",
