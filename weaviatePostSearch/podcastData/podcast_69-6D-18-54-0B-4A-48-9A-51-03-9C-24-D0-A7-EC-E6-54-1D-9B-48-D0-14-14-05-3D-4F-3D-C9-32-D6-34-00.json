    "Description": "  BONUS: The End of Product Management? Three Experts Reveal the Unstoppable Rise of Product Engineers With Anton Zaides, Rafa Paez, and Max Piechota <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this BONUS episode, we explore the emerging concept of the Product Engineer with three experts in the field: Anton Zaides, Rafa Paez, and Max Piechota. Together, they discuss how software engineers are evolving beyond just technical skills to embrace product thinking, business understanding, and customer empathy. This shift represents a move toward what they call \"M-skilled\" professionals who combine technical expertise with product sensibility to create greater impact.</p>   The Evolution of Software Engineering <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"The role of the software engineer is evolving to a product engineer...they understand what to build and why they are building it.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Rafa Paez kicks off the conversation by sharing insights from his article on Substack, titled \"The Rise of the 100x Product Engineer.\" He explains how the modern software engineer is taking on greater ownership of their work, focusing not just on writing code but understanding the underlying business reasons for features. This new breed of engineers thinks critically about product metrics, challenges assumptions, and takes extreme ownership of outcomes rather than just outputs.</p>   Breaking Product Management <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Engineers don't really care about what they work on...but what if they did?\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://newsletter.manager.dev/p/product-management-is-broken-and?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolboxPodcast\">  Anton Zaides discusses his provocative Substack article \"Product Management is broken, a change is coming,\"</a>  where he challenges the traditional separation between engineers and product decisions. He describes the phenomenon of the \"ZOOM-based product manager\" who remains disconnected from both users and engineers, and contrasts this with engineers who genuinely care about the products they build. Anton argues that when engineers are invested in the product outcomes, the entire development process improves.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2025/02/podcast/substack-week-why-product-management-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it-with-anton-zaides/\">  For a podcast episode with Anton Zaides about the Product Management is broken article, listen to this Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast episode</a>.</p>   Measuring What Matters <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"We need to measure the product outcome, the customer value and incentivize developers based on that.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Max Piechota shares how his journey toward product engineering began through conversations with his CEO about measuring software engineer performance. His research led him to realize that traditional engineering metrics often miss what truly matters - the value delivered to customers. Max advocates for aligning developer incentives with product outcomes rather than just code output, representing a fundamental shift in how we evaluate technical contributions.</p>   Catalyzing the Transformation <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"What helped me change was working with those people that wanted to create products.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  The conversation turns to practical ways to foster this evolution toward product engineering:</p> <ul style= \"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\"> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> Max describes how exposure to product-oriented colleagues and learning about the <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://theleanstartup.com/principles?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolboxPodcast\">  Lean Startup methodology</a>  transformed his perspective as a developer.</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> Anton outlines a three-step approach: helping engineers see metrics and user interactions, building business literacy, and connecting more deeply with the domain.</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> The group discusses the importance of helping engineers understand concepts like gross margin and the <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://mcgaw.io/blog/aarrr-pirate-metrics-for-startups/?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolboxPodcast\">  AARRR framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral)</a>.</p> </li> </ul>   Beyond Solutions to Problems <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Often we only focus on the solution, without understanding the actual problem we are trying to solve.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  One crucial insight from the conversation is the need for engineers to take a step back from solution mode and better understand the underlying problems.
