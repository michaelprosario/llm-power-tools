    "Description": "<p>Nicholas Zakas is a Front-end guy at Box and recently gave a talk called &quot;Enough with the JavaScript Already!&quot; where he advocates that developers use fewer libraries and write smarter JS. Where do we start? What are the four opportunities to load JavaScript? Is Progressive Enhancement still the right solution? Aren't we supposed to be writing MORE JavaScript? Nicholas educates Scott on all the right moves when writing front ends on today's web.</p>\n",
