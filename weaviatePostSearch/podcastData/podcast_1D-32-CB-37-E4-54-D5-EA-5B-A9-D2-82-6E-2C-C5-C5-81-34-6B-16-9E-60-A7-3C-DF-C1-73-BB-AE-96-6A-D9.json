    "Description": "  Anuj Ojha: Building Agile Team Maturity Through Honest Feedback <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  A successful Scrum Master should work towards making themselves unnecessary, but Anuj warns against common anti-patterns in this journey. He emphasizes the danger of viewing Scrum as a universal solution or behaving like a \"cult master\" who rigidly follows rules instead of listening to team needs. He advises against manipulating conversations or using others' authority to validate decisions. Instead, he promotes viewing Scrum as a continuous PDCA cycle and maintaining an open mind about different approaches.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How comfortable is your team with giving and receiving direct, constructive feedback to each other?</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Team Shared Self-Evaluation <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  This retrospective format focuses on building interpersonal relationships through structured feedback. Using a Google Form, team members answer two key questions about each colleague: what they appreciate about working with them and one change that could make them an even better team member. The format includes a sharing session where team members can process the feedback and discuss it openly. This approach encourages personal accountability by having participants first communicate what they themselves want to change before asking others to change.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
