    "Description": "<p>Cloud native computing is bringing about such a sea change in how applications are developed, deployed and run, that, not surprisingly, it is changing the rules for information security as well. Case in point: serverless computing.</p><p>In this latest edition of The New Stack makers podcast, we speak with Check Point's Cloud Security Strategist <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hillelsolow\">Hillel Solow</a>, who has been at the cutting edge of these changes.\u00a0 Solow co-founded Protego Labs, a <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/your-security-just-might-kill-your-serverless/\">pioneer in serverless security</a>. Security vendor Check Point saw the writing on the security wall early on and <a href=\"https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2019/check-point-extends-leadership-in-cloud-security-with-unmatched-serverless-protection/\">gobbled up</a> Protego in 2019. The New Stack Publisher <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a> and TNS Editor <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/joab/\">Joab Jackson</a> hosted this episode.</p>\n",
