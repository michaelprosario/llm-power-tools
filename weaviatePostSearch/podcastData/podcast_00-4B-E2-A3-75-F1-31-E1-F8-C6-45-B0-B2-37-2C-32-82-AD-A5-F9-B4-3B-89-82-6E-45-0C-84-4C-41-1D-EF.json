    "Description": "Rapi wasn\u2019t very politically engaged until his husband told him about Bernie Sanders, and soon after, Rapi was hooked. He joined the Coders for Sanders group and created the Bernie Map, an open source project that would become valuable for future movements. Rapi shares how he transferred the energy from the Coders for Sanders community to create the Progressive Coders Network, how he thinks about open source contributors as members instead of sources of free labor, and why open source is a powerful tool for activism.
