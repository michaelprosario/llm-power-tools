Arquay Harris (VP Engineering @ Webflow) underscores the importance of storytelling in public speaking, and shares valuable tips on how to craft a narrative and get your point across in a way that feels natural for <i>you</i>.</p><p>For Arquay\u2019s slides & original presentation from our 2022 Spring Virtual Summit - check out the full video here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GxMjT3\">https://bit.ly/3GxMjT3</a></p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arquay/\"><strong>ARQUAY HARRIS</strong></a></h2><p>Arquay is the VP of Engineering at <a href=\"https://webflow.com/\">Webflow</a>. Prior to Webflow, she held Engineering leadership positions at Slack, Google, and CBS Interactive. A developer who also has a Masters in Design, Arquay loves the marriage of form and function. When not working she can be found cooking, stumbling over guitar and piano chords, or watching Seinfeld.</p><blockquote><p>\"And so if you were using this to give an actual presentation, you might say something like, \u2018Imagine a world where deploys only take two seconds? Or what if tests only took 30 seconds to write?\u2019</p><p>So you're taking this undesirable thing and you're contrasting it with this idealistic future to really bring in that emotionality to get the audience hooked.</p><p>- Arquay Harris\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"http://orgspace.io/register\">Orgspace</a></h2><p>Orgspace is a management ops platform for software teams that helps your leaders scale.
