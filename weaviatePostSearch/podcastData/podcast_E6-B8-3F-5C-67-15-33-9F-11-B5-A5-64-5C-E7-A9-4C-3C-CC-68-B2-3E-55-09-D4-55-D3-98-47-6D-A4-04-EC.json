    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Richard Hicks about the new features of DirectAccess in Windows Server 2012. DirectAccess first made its appearance in Server 2008 R2 as a way to make VPN connectivity to the network less painful for users. But the server requirements were arduous, to the point that many IT folks could not deploy DirectAccess at all. Richard talks about how this second version of DirectAccess solves many of those problems. Windows Server 2012 isn't here quite yet, but when it is, you're going to want DirectAccess!</p>\n",
