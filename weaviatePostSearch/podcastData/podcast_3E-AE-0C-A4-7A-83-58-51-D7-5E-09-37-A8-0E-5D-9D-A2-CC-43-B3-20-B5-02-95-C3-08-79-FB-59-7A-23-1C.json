    "Description": "<p>Microsoft Ignite was huge! What's an Exchange admin to do? Richard chats Gareth Gudger about his favorite sessions from Ignite in Atlanta that focused on Exchange. The conversation roams over classic sessions around migration and living in a hybrid world (forever) to the more leading edge features of Office 365 including Groups and Planner. Gareth talks about how effective some of the Q and A sessions were, where great panelists interacted with the audience to explore subjects in a way that makes them much more real to the average Exchange admin. Lots of good stuff happened at Ignite - have a listen!</p>\n",
