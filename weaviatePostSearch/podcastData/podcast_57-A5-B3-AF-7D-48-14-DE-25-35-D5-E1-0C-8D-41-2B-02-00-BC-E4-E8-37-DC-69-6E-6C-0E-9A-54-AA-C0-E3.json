    "Description": "In 2013, Tyler Haney was a 24-year-old graduate of the Parsons School of Design in New York. One day on a jog, she realized that her workout outfits looked, and felt, like they were made for competitive athletes. Tyler envisioned a brand of athletic wear for more everyday activities, like walking the dog or hiking with friends. She launched Outdoor Voices and she got her two-piece \"kit\" \u2014 a crop top and leggings \u2013 into a few specialty boutiques. Soon afterward, her brand made it into J. Crew stores and took off. Today, Outdoor Voices has raised close to $60 million from investors and has around 350 employees. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" after a lunch with some new moms turned into baby bedlam, Beth Fynbo created Busy Baby Mat \u2014 a placemat that would securely stick on any table, keep toys off the floor, and provide a fun surface for babies to eat and draw.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
