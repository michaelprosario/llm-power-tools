    "Description": "<p>How do large language models fit into your organization? Richard chats with Ulrika Hedlund about the challenges sysadmins face with large language models in their company. Ulrika talks about how employees are already using large language models like ChatGPT - potentially risking leaking company data. Tools like Bing Chat Enterprise bring the same capabilities as ChatGPT but with a focus on keeping company data secure. Once you're comfortable with Bing Chat, you can explore Microsoft 365 Copilot, which can index company data as part of its model. Training is essential, as is good data protection management, but the productivity benefits can be huge!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/bing/chat/enterprise/?form=MA13FV\">Bing Chat Enterprise</a></li><li><a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/reinventing-productivity/\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/furthering-our-ai-ambitions-announcing-bing-chat-enterprise-and-microsoft-365-copilot-pricing/\">Copilot Licensing</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 10, 2023</p>\n",
