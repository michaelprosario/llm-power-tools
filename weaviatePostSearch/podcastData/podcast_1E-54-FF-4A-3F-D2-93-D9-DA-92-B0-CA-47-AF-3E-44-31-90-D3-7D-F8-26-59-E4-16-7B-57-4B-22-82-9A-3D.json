    "Description": "<p>This week Jonathan Bennett and Dan Lynch talk with Fran\u00e7ois Proulx of BoostSecurity, talking about the Poutine security scanner, available at <a href= \"https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine\">https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine</a>. It's all about the security vulnerabilities that may lurk in your Github Actions, and Gitlab Pipelines. When someone sends in a pull request, could they run arbitrary code, and is that going to bite you? Listen to find out!</p> <p>You can join the conversation in\u00a0<a href= \"https://discord.gg/GNeFvChvnz?event=1217585022589206670\">the Hackaday Discord</a>, where the show records live each week, as well as getting the full story and show links from Hackaday.
