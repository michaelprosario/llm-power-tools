    "Description": "<p>Today's show is different - it is longer than usual. I share some stories of insults, struggles, mistakes, and joys of teaching. The hope is that you'll be encouraged, not feel alone, and remember why we do this profession. These are my stories digging back many years in some cases of the things that have changed my view and made me a better teacher - even when they were hard. Teaching, your job is so important. I hope you have a Happy Valentine's Day!</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e439\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e439</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Right now, 10-minute Teacher Listeners can save 20% off each course with the code COOL20 at <a href= \"https://advancementcourses.com/coolcat\">advancementcourses.com/coolcat</a>.
