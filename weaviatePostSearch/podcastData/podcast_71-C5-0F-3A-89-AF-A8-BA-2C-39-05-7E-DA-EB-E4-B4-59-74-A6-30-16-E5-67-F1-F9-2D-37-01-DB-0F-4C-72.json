    "Description": "<p>Today I'm joined by Dr. Curran Kelleher. He's a data visualization expert and has taught a number of in-depth data visualization courses on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.</p> <p>We talk about what it's like to get a Ph.D. under one of the pioneers of data visualization.\u00a0</p> <p>We also talk about how he uses his visualization skills in industry, his many years living in India, and his love of teaching.</p> <p>I think you're going to walk away with a deeper understanding of data, the human brain, and how we process information. You'll also learn some practical career tips.</p> <p>I hope these weekly freeCodeCamp podcasts are firing you up about learning more about technology.</p> <p>Tell your friends about the freeCodeCamp podcast. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.</p> <p>Some relevant links from our discussion:</p> <p>Curran's 20-hour Data Visualization with D3 course on freeCodeCamp: <a href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-visualizatoin-with-d3/\">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-visualizatoin-with-d3/</a></p> <p>\"Semiology of Graphics: Diagrams, Networks, Maps\" book Curran mentions: <a href= \"https://www.esri.com/en-us/esri-press/browse/semiology-of-graphics-diagrams-networks-maps\"> https://www.esri.com/en-us/esri-press/browse/semiology-of-graphics-diagrams-networks-maps</a></p> <p>Curran's portfolio of work: <a href= \"https://github.com/curran/portfolio\">https://github.com/curran/portfolio</a></p> <p>Bret Victor's talk \"Inventing on Principle\"\uff1a <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGYGl_xxfXA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGYGl_xxfXA</a></p>",
