    "Description": "Join us in this enlightening episode as we sit down with LaToya Hodge, a multi-faceted professional who's made an incredible journey from a first-generation professional to respected storyteller that translates complex problems into digestible information for everyday users. LaToya's story is nothing short of inspiring, and in just five words - a storyteller, tenacious, persistent, a mentor, and a big thinker.\nLaToya's favorite quote, start Where You Are. Use What You Have. Do What You Can,' by Arthur Ashe, and from there we coined a new way of looking at life which is summed up as Creativity is free and now we refer to that as LaToyism.\nHer thoughts about Generative AI?\u00a0 It is an exciting tool that also needs guardrails to protect people against bad behavior. Robots won\u2019t come and kill us. AI can make it impossible for people to have healthcare or a mortgage. We should embrace a quote that Walter Cronkite was infamous for \u201cTrust but verify.\u201d\nHashtags: #iHeartRadio #ApplePodcasts #GooglePlay #Spotify #Stitcher #Podbean #YouTube #Employers4Change #E4C #internships #radio #podcast #innovation #employers #smallbusiness #business #FutureOfWork #ValenciaCollegeRadio\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",
