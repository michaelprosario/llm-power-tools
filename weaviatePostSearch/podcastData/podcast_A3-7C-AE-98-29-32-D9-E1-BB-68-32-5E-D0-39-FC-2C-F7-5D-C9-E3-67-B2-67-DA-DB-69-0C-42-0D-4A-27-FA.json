    "Description": "  CTO Series: Mastering the CTPO Role, Katrina Clokie\u2019s Guide to Tech and Product Leadership <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  In this BONUS episode, we sit down with Katrina Clokie, a seasoned leader in strategy, change management, and building inclusive teams. Katrina shares pivotal moments in her career, offers practical leadership insights, and discusses her role as Chief Technology and Product Officer (CTPO), where she\u2019s balancing innovation with business objectives. Whether you\u2019re an aspiring tech leader or looking to sharpen your leadership toolkit, Katrina\u2019s wisdom will inspire you to embrace growth, resilience, and collaboration.</p>   Defining Moments in Leadership <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cLook for roles you can\u2019t fully do yet\u2014it\u2019s the best way to grow.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Katrina reflects on a transformative moment early in her career when a mentor from the shipping industry encouraged her to seek out challenging roles that would push her growth. This advice set her on the path to engineering management and C-level leadership. She shares how fostering curiosity and pursuing conversations about topics she didn\u2019t yet fully understand has kept her continually learning.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cAsk yourself: where do I feel stretched? That\u2019s often where the best growth opportunities lie.\u201d</p>   The Role of CTPO: Combining Technology and Product Strategy <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cWe needed both a unified vision and an efficient structure to remain competitive.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Katrina discusses why her company created the CTPO role and how it reflects the size and growth stage of the organization. With no prior head of product, Katrina leaned into her experience while recognizing the importance of partnering with skilled product managers. She emphasizes the importance of having clear accountabilities and embracing growth within the role.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cThe key is knowing when to lead and when to lean on your team\u2019s expertise.\u201d</p>   Aligning Tech Strategy with Business Objectives <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cTrade-offs are inevitable\u2014make them strategically, not reactively.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  At Fergus, Katrina implemented clear guardrails, such as avoiding a complete rewrite of their decade-old monolith, focusing instead on retiring components that hindered stability and developer experience. She shares how they allocate 60% of engineering capacity to strategic initiatives and 40% to ongoing business needs, ensuring tech and business priorities stay aligned.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cGuardrails help teams make decisions that align with the big picture without constant oversight.\u201d</p>   Fostering Cross-Functional Collaboration <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cHealthy conflict is necessary\u2014escalation usually signals a breakdown in structure.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Katrina describes how she structured cross-functional teams with clear goals and metrics to foster collaboration and ensure diverse perspectives are represented. She highlights the importance of empathy and role-modeling constructive conflict resolution at senior levels.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cA well-designed structure turns potential conflict into productive problem-solving.\u201d</p>   Roadmapping with Flexibility and Focus <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cRoadmaps should guide\u2014not handcuff\u2014teams to long-term commitments.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Katrina\u2019s approach to roadmapping balances transparency and adaptability. By reserving only 60% of capacity for roadmap initiatives and keeping annual plans intentionally light, her teams can pivot when necessary without overcommitting. Frequent, smaller releases (up to 160 changes per month) help deliver value continuously.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cLeave room in your roadmap to handle surprises without derailing progress.\u201d</p>   Scaling Teams During Rapid Growth <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cAvoid constant recruiting\u2014it can burn out your leaders and upset team dynamics.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Drawing from her experience at Xero, Katrina advises against an \u201calways-on\u201d recruitment strategy, which can overwhelm hiring managers and disrupt team cohesion. Instead, she recommends batch hiring and partnering with finance and talent teams to manage hiring budgets in stages.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cHiring in waves allows teams to stabilize and thrive, rather than constantly adjusting.\u201d</p>   Overcoming the Challenges of Growth and Constraints <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cShifting from hyper-growth to steady growth meant saying \u2018no\u2019 more often and being precise.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Katrina shares how transitioning from an environment of rapid scaling to a more constrained SaaS company required a shift in her approach to decision-making. She focused on making the business context clear to her team, fostering trust and transparency in her decision-making process.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cWhen people understand the \u2018why\u2019 behind constraints, they\u2019re more likely to trust the process.\u201d</p>   Recommended Reads for Tech Leaders <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Katrina shares the books that have shaped her leadership journey:</p> <ul style= \"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\"> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4h7NVDM\"> Resilient Management by Lara Hogan</a></p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3BXiWLW\"> The Manager\u2019s Path by Camille Fournier</a></p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4gGZjqs\"> The Engineering Executive\u2019s Primer by Will Larson</a></p> </li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cGreat leadership isn\u2019t innate\u2014it\u2019s learned through mentorship, reflection, and resources.\u201d</p>   Scaling Your Influence as a Leader <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  From her experience at global companies to her current role, Katrina\u2019s insights on transparency, collaboration, and strategic trade-offs provide a blueprint for navigating the complexities of tech leadership.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cLeadership isn\u2019t about having all the answers\u2014it\u2019s about empowering your team and staying open to learning.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  About Katrina Clokie</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Katrina Clokie is a respected leader in strategy, change management, and building inclusive teams.
