    "Description": "\n        <p>Bryan and Shannon Miles, cofounders of the wildly successful virtual support provider <a href=\"https://belaysolutions.com/\">BELAY</a>, have done what many would think impossible: create a unified and thriving culture among a team made up entirely of telecommuters. Turns out you don\u2019t need to work in the same building\u2014or in some cases, even the same state\u2014to foster excellent communication, unparalleled accountability, and good morale. In lieu of a corporate office, Bryan and Shannon have decided to invest in their team instead of infrastructure. If eight years in business, 60 employees, and 500 contractors are any indication, it looks like they\u2019re doing something <em>really</em> right. Tune in to find out how to do the same in your organization, virtual or not. Also joining us is All Access member Renee Daggett, president of <a href=\"http://www.adminbooks.com/\">AdminBooks</a>, to highlight what you need to know now about the new tax bill.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/form-opt-in-taxprep\">ELP Small Business Tax Prep Checklist</a>\u00a0from EntreLeadership</p> <p><a href=\"http://learn.infusionsoft.com/resources/guides/complete-marketing-planner/\"> Lifecycle Marketing</a> from Infusionsoft</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
