    "Description": "<p>I love that an exploration of Doom is Episode 666. Fabian Sanglard has written The Game Engine Black Book: Doom as a deep exploration of the history, impact, and code that made Doom a cultural phenomenon.  The book was released exactly 25 years after DOOM.zip was first published on the University of Wisconsin FTP server in December 1993.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom</li>\n</ul>\n",
