    "Description": "\n        <p>Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken began as a tiny pop-up, selling spicy chicken tenders and fries from a tent in East Hollywood. Their homemade take on Nashville Hot Chicken was an overnight sensation in a city that had barely heard of it, and within days, co-founder Arman Oganesyan and his partners were working frantically to serve the long lines out front. Since launching seven years ago, the pop-up has grown into a chain of 200 stores, with franchises across the country, and a beloved rubber chicken mascot.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Sam Paulson with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>It was edited by Neva Grant with research help from Katherine Sypher.
