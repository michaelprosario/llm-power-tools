    "Description": "<p>While at DevIntersection in Las Vegas, Richard sat down with Mark Minasi to talk about Windows 8.1. And some of the show is even about Windows 8.1! Mark dives into a discussion around Server 2012R2 (the server side of Windows 8.1) and how Hyper-V is all over VMWare these days. The conversation also explores the evolution of Active Directory, and possibly it's end. Lots of interesting thought and exploration over what it means to live in the latest Windows world.</p>\n",
