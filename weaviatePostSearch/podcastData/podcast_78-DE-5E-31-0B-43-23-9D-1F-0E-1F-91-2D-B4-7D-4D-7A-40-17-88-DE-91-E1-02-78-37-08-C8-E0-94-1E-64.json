    "Description": "<p>Farhan Thawar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fnthawar\">@fnthawar</a>) , VP of Engineering @ <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/\">Shopify</a> shares the hiring framework he\u2019s built where 15-minute interviews result in both faster placements AND better fits. You\u2019ll hear how to find talent in non-traditional ways, what happens when you leverage creativity, and how speed in hiring is a massive competitive advantage.</p><p><i>\u201cThe problem with interviews in general are they're very biased to either things you've done before or they're biased to some other signal...like school you went to company, you worked for, GPA in some cases, right? Google used to use that... And it excludes a wide swath of people. That's my number one problem with interviews. Not that good candidates can pass an interview. It's that non-traditional candidates will likely fail your interview\u201d</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>ABOUT FARHAN THAWAR</strong></p><p>Farhan is currently VP, Engineering at Shopify via the acquisition of Helpful.com where he was co-founder and CTO.
