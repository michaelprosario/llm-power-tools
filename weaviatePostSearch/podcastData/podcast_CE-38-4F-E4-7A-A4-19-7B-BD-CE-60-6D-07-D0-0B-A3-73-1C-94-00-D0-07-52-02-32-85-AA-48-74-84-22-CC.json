    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Peggy Wang.  She used freeCodeCamp to learn coding. She then worked in Big Tech as a robotics engineer. And now she's cofounder and CTO of Ego AI, a Y-Combinator-backed startup that builds human-like agents for video games.</p> <p>We talk about: - How she grew up a first generation American and public school kid in Milwaukee - How her love of robotics helped her get into Stanford - How freeCodeCamp served as a key resource to build her developer chops - The near future of humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and human-like AI agents in games</p> <p>Support for this podcast comes from a grant from Wix Studio.
