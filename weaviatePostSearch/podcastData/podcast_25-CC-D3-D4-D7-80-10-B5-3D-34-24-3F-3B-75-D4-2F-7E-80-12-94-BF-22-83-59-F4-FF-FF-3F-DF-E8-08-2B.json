    "Description": "<p>Albert Strasheim, CTO & SVP of Engineering @ Rippling, joins us to share the riveting story of how Rippling\u2019s leadership navigated the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. He reveals what was at stake for his company & the hundreds of millions of dollars at stake for customers & their employees, how Rippling\u2019s core values influenced their critical decision-making, tips for communicating with clarity both internally & externally, and tactics that allowed the team to respond with precision during crisis. Additionally, Albert shares the pre-crisis strategies, habits & systems he is most thankful for that helped Rippling leadership respond successfully throughout this critical period.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertstrasheim/\"><strong>ALBERT STRASHEIM</strong></a></h2><p>Albert Strasheim is Rippling's CTO and SVP, Engineering. Albert leads the global engineering team as it continues to expand the capabilities of Rippling\u2019s products and the platform itself.

Albert lives in the Bay Area and is an avid skier and surfer.</p><blockquote><p>\"I think we had about $130 million on the way to employees of our clients. This was more than 50,000 people. They are not like rich Silicon Valley tech workers. It's everyday Americans making less than $55,000 a year. Some of them are living paycheck to paycheck and so missing a paycheck can have devastating consequences. We had to move really quickly to make sure these folks got paid. Basically, no matter what happened with SVB, those were the stakes. It's like people that critically needed money just wouldn't get it otherwise.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Albert Strasheim \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Check out</strong> <a href=\"http://www.qawolf.com/elc\"><strong>QA Wolf</strong></a><strong>!</strong></h2><p>Looking for a way to increase end-to-end test coverage, speed up your release cycles and reduce bugs from shipping to production?
