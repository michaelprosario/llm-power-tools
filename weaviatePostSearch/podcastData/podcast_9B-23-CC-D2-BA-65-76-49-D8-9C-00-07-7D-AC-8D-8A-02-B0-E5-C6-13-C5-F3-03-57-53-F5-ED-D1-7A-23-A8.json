    "Description": "<p>The pandemic has significantly accelerated the adoption of Kubernetes and cloud native environments as a way to accommodate the surge in remote workers and other infrastructure constraints. Following the beginning of the pandemic, however, organizations are retaining their investments for those organizations with cloud native infrastructure already in place. They have realized that cloud native is well worth maintaining their investments. Meanwhile, Kubernetes adoption continues to remain on an upward curve. And yet, challenges remain, needless to say. In this context, we look at the status of cloud native adoption, and in particular, Kubernetes at this time, compared to a year ago.\u00a0</p><p>In this episode of<a href=\"/tag/the-new-stack-makers\"> The New Stack Makers podcast</a>, recorded on the floor of<a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/\"> KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022</a>, we discussed these themes along with the state of Kubernetes and the community with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesLaverack?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">James Laverack</a>, staff solutions engineer, <a href=\"https://www.jetstack.io/\">Jetstack</a> a member of the Kubernetes release team, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cblecker/?originalSubdomain=ca\">Christoph Blecker</a>, site reliability engineer, <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/fr\">Red Hat</a>, a member of the Kubernetes steering committee.</p>\n",
