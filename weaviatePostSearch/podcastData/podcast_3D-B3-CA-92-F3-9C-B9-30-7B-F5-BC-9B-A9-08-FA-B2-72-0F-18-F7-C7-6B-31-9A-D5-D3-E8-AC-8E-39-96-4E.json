    "Description": "\n        Bobbi Brown started out as a makeup artist in New York City, but hated the gaudy color palette of the 1980s. She eventually shook up the industry by introducing \"nude makeup\" with neutral colors and a natural tone. In 1995, Est\u00e9e Lauder acquired Bobbi Brown Cosmetics and Bobbi remained there for 22 years, until she realized the brand was no longer the one she had built. PLUS, for our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how Emma Cohen and Miles Pepper saw a problem with plastics and developed a collapsible, reusable drinking straw.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n      ",
