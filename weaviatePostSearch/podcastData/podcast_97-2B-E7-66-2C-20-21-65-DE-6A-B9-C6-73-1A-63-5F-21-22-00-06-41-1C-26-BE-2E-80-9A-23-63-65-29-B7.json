    "Description": "\n        <p>As a business owner, before you can take your business from where it is to where you want to go, you first have to understand what that next step actually looks like. While we can talk endlessly about some of the external features of a business that is scaling up, we believe that the best way to understand the size of a business is through the type of leadership that each stage requires. </p><p>In today's episode, Michael Hyatt and Megan Hyatt Miller talk through the Four Stages of Scaling Your Business. For each stage, you will learn what the leader is doing, what the business' goal is, what the potential pitfalls are, and how people identify the business' brand. </p><p>To download the full chart that outlines the Four Stages of Scaling <em>for free</em>, visit <a href=\"https://fullfocus.co/scaling/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://fullfocus.co/scaling/</a>.</p><p>For more podcasts, visit\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.businessaccelerator.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.businessaccelerator.com/podcast</a>.</p><p><strong>The Business Accelerator podcast is a reflection of the values and processes inside the BusinessAccelerator coaching program.
