    "Description": "<p>Nobody's data security is perfect, but do you know the security state of your data? Richard chats with Luke Babarinde about his work helping companies secure their data effectively and understand where the risks exist. The rules vary from company to company, and it takes time to education management on what risks exist for data, and ultimately to get feedback on what levels of security are reasonable. Luke talks about how every system is breachable, its just a question of what happens next - how long does it take to detect a breach? How do you limit harm? Lots of great thinking from someone out there in the trenches trying to protect data!</p>\n",
