    "Description": "<p>Wayfair describes itself as the \u201cthe destination for all things home: helping everyone, anywhere create their feeling of home.\u201d It provides an online platform to acquire home furniture, outdoor decor and other furnishings. It also supports its suppliers so they can use the platform to sell their home goods, explained <a href=\"https://de.linkedin.com/in/natalivlatko\">Natali Vlatko,</a> global lead, open source program office (OSPO) and senior software engineering manager, for Wayfair as the featured guest in Detroit during<a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/\"> </a><a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/\">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2022</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt takes a lot of technical, technical work behind the scenes to kind of get that going,\u201d Vlatko said. This is especially true as Wayfair scales its operations worldwide. The infrastructure must be highly distributed, relying on containerization, microservices, Kubernetes, and especially, open source to get the job done.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe have technologists throughout the world, in North America and throughout Europe as well,\u201d \u00a0Vlatko said. \u201cAnd we want to make sure that we are utilizing cloud native and open source, not just as technologies that fuel our business, but also as the ways that are great for us to work in now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Open source has served as a \u201cgreat avenue\u201d for creating and offering technical services, and to accomplish that, Vlatko amassed the requite tallent, she said. Vlatko was able to amass a small team of engineers to focus on platform work, advocacy, community management and internally on compliance with licenses.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>About five years ago when Vlatko joined Wayfair, the company had yet to go \u201cfull tilt into going all cloud native,\u201d \u00a0Vlatko said. Wayfair had a hybrid mix of on-premise and cloud infrastructure. After decoupling from a monolith into a microservices architecture \u201cthat journey really began where we understood the really great benefits of microservices and got to a point where we thought, \u2018okay, this hybrid model for us actually would benefit our microservices being fully in the cloud,\u201d Vlatko said. In late 2020, Wayfair had made the decision to \u201cget out of the data centers\u201d and shift operations to the cloud, which was completed in October, Vlatko said.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The company culture is such that engineers have room to experiment without major fear of failure by doing a lot of development work in a sandbox environment. \u201cWe've been able to create production environments that are close to our production environments so that experimentation in sandboxes can occur. Folks can learn as they go without actually fearing failure or fearing a mistake,\u201d \u00a0Vlatko said. \u201cSo, I think experimentation is a really important aspect of our own learning and growth for cloud native. Also, coming to great events like KubeCon + CloudNativeCon and other events [has been helpful]. We're hearing from other companies who've done the same journey and process and are learning from the use cases.\u201d</p>\n",
