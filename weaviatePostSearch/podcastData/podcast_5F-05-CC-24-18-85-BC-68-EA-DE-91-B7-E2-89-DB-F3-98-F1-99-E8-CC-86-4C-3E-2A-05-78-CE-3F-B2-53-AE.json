    "Description": "\n        <p>After years spent traveling the globe working with top CEOs, world-renowned leadership coach and best-selling author <a href=\"http://www.marshallgoldsmith.com/\">Dr. Marshall Goldsmith</a> has discovered a universal truth: We all make mistakes. And oftentimes, even the seemingly inconsequential ones (for instance, not saying thank you enough) can undermine the most skilled, charismatic leaders. Luckily, there are four behaviors you can adopt right now that can help put you on a more successful\u2014and likely more profitable\u2014leadership path. And though Marshall\u2019s advice is simple and straightforward, don\u2019t expect real change to come overnight without some major commitment and determination on your end. As Marshall likes to say, the challenge in life is not the <em>understanding</em>; it\u2019s the <em>doing</em>. Tune in to find out how to make the most of Marshall\u2019s proven and practical methods in your own business. Also, our very own Armando Lopez, Executive Director of Human Resources, joins us to answer <em>your</em> questions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.marshallgoldsmith.com/product/book-2/\"><em>What Got You Here Won't Get You</em> There</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/summit/\">EntreLeadership Summit</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/sms-opt-in-decision\">Decision Making Checklist</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://learn.infusionsoft.com/resources/guides/small-business-trends-report?PartnerId=001j000000YDIsB&amp;AffiliateCode=a60166&amp;CampaignId=701j0000001mlwy&amp;TrackingLinkId=a1Bf1000003fRBL&amp;Link_Posted_By__c=005j000000DNBat&amp;ls=strat-bizdev_general_isebook~EntreLeadershipPodcast_2018TrendsReport~2017-12-13__&amp;utm_source=general&amp;utm_medium=strat-bizdev&amp;utm_campaign=isebook~EntreLeadershipPodcast_2018TrendsReport~2017-12-13__\"> 2018 Small Business Marketing Trends Report</a></p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
