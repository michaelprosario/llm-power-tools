    "Description": "You put on a headset in a real life beauty salon in real life, and, in seconds, you\u2019re transported to a virtual one. It\u2019s full of colors, shapes, music, and the soothing voice of a narrator. She explains that you\u2019re in a different world now, and you\u2019re about to contribute to the \u201csynaptic lineage.\u201d The setting is intriguing and futuristic, the story is unique, and every detail so carefully laid out. We talk to Carmen Aguilar y Wedge, one of the creators of the NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism, a virtual reality experience that\u2019s appeared at Sundance, Tribeca, and a number of other film festivals. She shares how she and her team at Hyphen Labs created this artistic and deeply technical exhibit. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
