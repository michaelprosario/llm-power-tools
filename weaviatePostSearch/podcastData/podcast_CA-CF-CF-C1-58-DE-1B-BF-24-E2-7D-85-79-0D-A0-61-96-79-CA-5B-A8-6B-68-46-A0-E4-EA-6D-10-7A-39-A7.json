    "Description": "<p class=\"p1\">Today, the topic of racism has brought about discussions of not only organizational reform but also reform in our personal perceptions. Today, Dr. Andrea Dozier and I will talk about hope in the midst of understanding. We approach this topic with humility and sincerity and I hope as you listen to our perspectives of being two different women living in the southern United States that we might come away realizing that we\u2019re not as different as we might think. In this podcast, we share our thoughts about working with others, dealing with injustice, and standing for positive change.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Andrea is a friend and she also has a blog that I recommend \"<a href= \"https://strengthforyourmountaindiaries.blogspot.com/\">Strength for Your Mountain Diaries</a>.\" Check out Andrea and let me know on Twitter what you think.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e686\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e686</a>\u00a0</p> Dr. Andrea Dozier - Bio as Submitted <p>Dr. Andrea Dozier has been providing instruction in higher education for over 18 years.
