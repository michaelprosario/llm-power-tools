    "Description": "<p>The hardware industry is surging, driven by AI's demanding workloads, with Arm\u2014a 35-year-old pioneer in processor IP\u2014playing a pivotal role. In an episode of<i>The New Stack Makers</i>recorded at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America, Pranay Bakre, principal solutions engineer at Arm, discussed how Arm is helping organizations migrate and run applications on its technology.</p><p>Bakre highlighted Arm\u2019s partnership with hyperscalers like AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle, showcasing processors such as AWS Graviton and Google Axion, built on Arm\u2019s power-efficient, cost-effective Neoverse IP. This design ethos has spurred wide adoption, with 90-95% of CNCF projects supporting native Arm binaries.</p><p>Attendees at Arm\u2019s booth frequently inquired about its plans to support AI workloads. Bakre noted the performance advantages of Arm-based infrastructure, delivering up to 60% workload improvements over legacy architectures. The episode also features a demo on migrating x86 applications to ARM64 in both cloud and containerized environments, emphasizing Arm\u2019s readiness for the AI era.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Arm:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/arm-eyes-ai-with-its-latest-neoverse-cores-and-subsystems/\">Arm Eyes AI with Its Latest Neoverse Cores and Subsystem</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/big-three-in-cloud-prompts-arm-to-rethink-software/\">Big Three in Cloud Prompts ARM to Rethink Software</a></p><p><br /><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
