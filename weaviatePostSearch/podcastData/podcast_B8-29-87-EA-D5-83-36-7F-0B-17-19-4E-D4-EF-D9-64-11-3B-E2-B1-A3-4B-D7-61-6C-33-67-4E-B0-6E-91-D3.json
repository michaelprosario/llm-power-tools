    "Description": "  Agile in Hardware: Bringing Agile to Hardware Development \u2013 Insights from Microsoft, Apple, and More With John Collins <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  In this agile in hardware episode, John Collins dives deep into the practicalities, challenges, and rewards of integrating Agile methodologies in hardware engineering, drawing from his extensive experience at companies like Microsoft, Apple, and FlixBus. Collins offers actionable advice on adapting Agile frameworks to hardware environments, covering everything from psychological safety to coordinating across diverse teams with different goals and development cadences. For anyone looking to understand the nuances of Agile in a hardware setting, this episode is full of valuable insights.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Starting Out with Agile in Hardware Engineering <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a leadership role, it\u2019s not just about the process \u2013 it\u2019s about creating an environment of safety where teams feel empowered to take risks and try new approaches.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  John Collins shares how he first started implementing Agile principles in hardware engineering, despite the challenges posed by larger organizations like Apple and Microsoft. He discusses the importance of psychological safety as a foundation for Agile success and reflects on the training needed to foster an Agile mindset among engineers used to traditional, linear development approaches.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cThe Agile journey starts by influencing teams and creating an environment where everyone feels secure and motivated to try new things.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Crafting an Agile Framework for Hardware <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cAligning software and hardware development isn\u2019t about making them the same; it\u2019s about finding the right synchronization points and respecting each team\u2019s unique process.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  John explains his approach to choosing and adapting Agile frameworks for his teams, describing how he brought software and hardware workflows into alignment through careful planning and OKRs. He shares tips on setting frameworks like SAFe, Scrum, or custom Agile processes, ensuring that hardware and software teams coordinate effectively without stifling autonomy.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cUsing shared goals like OKRs helps both hardware and software teams work together without losing their individual strengths.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Key Differences Between Agile in Software and Hardware <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cIn hardware, there are fixed constraints and build cycles dictated by suppliers and physical limitations \u2013 Agile can adapt, but it takes patience.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  In this segment, John highlights the key differences in Agile application between software and hardware teams. He explains why skepticism can be a healthy part of the process, and how roles like the Agile coach help teams embrace new methodologies. John also emphasizes the importance of matching Agile coaches to team dynamics to ensure effective adoption.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cEvery Agile coach and team is unique \u2013 finding the right match is essential to making Agile work in hardware.\u201d</p>   Overcoming Challenges in Agile Hardware Development <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cHardware requires a structured approach with build schedules and physical constraints, which makes Agile\u2019s flexibility more challenging to implement.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  John dives into the unique challenges of implementing Agile in hardware, especially around the rigidity of build cycles and long testing periods. He shares strategies for mitigating these constraints, like prioritizing issues by risk impact and using statistical models to allocate resources for destructive testing. This practical advice helps listeners understand the importance of adaptability within Agile for hardware.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cLeverage data from past builds to predict impact, prioritize risk, and optimize your testing and build resources.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Resources for Adopting Agile in Hardware <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  John refers to the <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://management30.com/\"> Management 3.0 training</a>  as a good foundation to prepare people for adopting Agile, and also combining Agile and Hardware.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  About John Collins</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  John Collins is a former Senior Vice President of Engineering, known for driving strategic growth in large international teams across software and hardware.
