    "Description": "\n        In the early 1990s, as Amanda Hesser's college friends were interviewing for their first cubicle jobs, she chose a different path: one that led straight into the kitchens of Europe, where she cooked traditional recipes and learned the rhythm of the seasons from a crusty French gardener.

But over time she grew restless, and in 2008, gave up that dream job\u2014and the stability that went with it\u2014to become an entrepreneur.
