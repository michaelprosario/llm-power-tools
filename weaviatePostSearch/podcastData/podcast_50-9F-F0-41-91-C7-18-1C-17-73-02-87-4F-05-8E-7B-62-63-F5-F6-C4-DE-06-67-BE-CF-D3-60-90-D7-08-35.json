    "Description": "<p>Pricey down payments have put homeownership out of reach for many Americans, especially those who don\u2019t have access to intergenerational wealth. This issue is particularly acute in cities, where the salaries of essential workers like educators, healthcare professionals, and municipal service providers haven\u2019t kept pace with skyrocketing home values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>An introductory finance course got Alex Lofton thinking about his own experience with this issue \u2014 and creative ways to address it. In 2015, he and two co-founders launched Landed, a for-profit company that offers down payment assistance in exchange for a share in a home\u2019s eventual appreciation.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Alex talks with Guy about his company\u2019s work to help more Americans build wealth by purchasing homes. Alex also recounts how working for the Obama for America campaign in 2008 influenced his approach to organizational leadership, plus he and Guy discuss the potential consequences of capitalism unchecked.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was produced by Sam Paulson and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
