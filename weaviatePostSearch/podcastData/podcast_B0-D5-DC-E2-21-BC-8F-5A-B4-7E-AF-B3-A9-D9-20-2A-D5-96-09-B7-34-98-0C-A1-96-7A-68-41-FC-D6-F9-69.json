    "Description": "<p>Ludo Antonov, VP of Engineering @ WhatNot, shares how eng leaders can better operate from their organization\u2019s first principles. He defines the concept & what that looks like for WhatNot through their values of listening to customers, moving uncomfortably fast, and more \u2013 plus what happens when optimizing for one principle conflicts with another! We also cover Ludo\u2019s leadership journey, how he navigated the transition from a business model focused on discovery & matching to two-sided marketplaces, and challenges / lessons learned from working within the social, community, & marketplace space.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lantonov/\"><strong>LUDO ANTONOV</strong></a></h2><p>Ludo (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ludo_antonov\">@ludo_antonov</a>) is the Vice President of Engineering at Whatnot. He has an extensive background in building engineering teams at fast-growing startups including Hulu, Pinterest, and Lyft. He led the Pinterest Growth team as the company was going through hyper-growth up to IPO. Prior to joining Whatnot, he served as an engineering executive at Lyft, overseeing the company\u2019s core rideshare products including the rider, driver, marketplace, and growth organizations.</p><blockquote><p>\"That's one of the important parts is it allows for common language to fall back to whenever these problems actually happen because they tend to be more and more complex and take more and more nuance in order to get right and sometimes, especially like it's very powerful to take it back to first principles and say, 'How would we do this if we have to be ruthlessly prioritizing? Are we moving comfortably fast in thinking of our approach?' And then everyone understands because it's part of our vocabulary and it takes repetition to build that.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Ludo Antonov \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Join us at ELC Annual 2023!</h2><p>ELC Annual is our flagship conference for engineering leaders.
