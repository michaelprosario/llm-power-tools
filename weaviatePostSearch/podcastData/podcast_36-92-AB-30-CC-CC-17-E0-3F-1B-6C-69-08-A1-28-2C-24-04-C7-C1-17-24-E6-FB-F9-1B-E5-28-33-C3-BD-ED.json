So if you consider yourself as part of a team, part of a community, part of a group, and if you know their happiness matters to you, if their comfort matters to you, advocating for them is advocating for yourself because if they're happier, you're happier. So I feel that for leaders who want their teams to be successful, this is something you do for yourself too because you want them to be successful.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Shailvi Wakhlu \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>We\u2019re hosting the first ELC Annual Watch Party on 11/8!</h2><p>We\u2019re livestreaming the most popular sessions from the ELC Annual 2023 conference + hosting virtual roundtable discussions to connect you with eng leaders around the globe AND in your city.</p><p>Our first topic covers Generative AI & engineering leadership with Wade Chambers\u2026 no this isn\u2019t about the tech - it\u2019s about the leadership skills and competencies you need to evolve and adapt to lead in this next generation!</p><h3><i><strong>We have different events for Europe, East Coast & West Coast!
