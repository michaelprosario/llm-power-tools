    "Description": "  Global Agile Summit Preview: Unifying Strategy, Discovery, and Delivery in Product Development With Roman Pichler <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this BONUS <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/global-agile-summit-pre-summit-networking-event/?utm_source=e1025_02_em&utm_medium=e1025_02_em\">  Global Agile Summit preview episode</a>, we explore a crucial topic that's shaping how we approach product development\u2014sometimes in ways that serve us well and sometimes in ways that hold us back.\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  There's a growing trend in our industry to explicitly separate strategy, discovery, and delivery into distinct activities or even different teams.  On the surface, this seems logical: strategy decides the right thing to do, discovery figures out how to do it, and delivery gets it done. But is this division actually helping us? Or is it creating barriers that make great product development harder?</p>   The Origins of Product Discovery <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"I think it's partly based, at least on Marty Cagan's work, and his insight that many teams are very much focused traditionally on delivering outputs, on writing code. And I think his original intention was to say, 'Let's not worry about creating outputs. Let's also make sure that what we creating makes sense.'\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Roman Pichler shares insights on how the concept of product discovery emerged as a reaction to teams being overly focused on outputs rather than outcomes. He explains that conceptually distinguishing between product strategy, discovery, and delivery can be helpful\u2014much like organizing clothes into different sections of a wardrobe. However, in reality, these activities must be connected, informing and guiding each other rather than existing as sequential steps.</p>   The Risks of Separating Product Strategy, from Discovery, and from Delivery <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"If we have a group of people who takes care of strategic decisions, a different group focusing on product discovery, and another group\u2014the tech team\u2014who focuses on product delivery, and those groups don't talk as much as they could and should do, then suddenly we have a sequential process and handoffs.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  One of the primary challenges with separating strategy, discovery, and delivery is the risk of creating handoffs between different teams. Roman highlights how this sequential approach can slow down value creation, lead to knowledge loss, and increase the likelihood of introducing mistakes. This separation can create barriers that ultimately make product development more difficult and less effective.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to the <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2019/01/podcast/bonus-tim-herbig-on-lateral-leadership-a-critical-skill-for-scrum-masters-and-product-owners/\">  podcast interview with Tim Herbig on the concept of Lateral Leadership, and how that is critical for product people</a>.</p>   Integrating the Work Streams <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"What I usually use as a visualization tool is three work streams: a strategy work stream, a discovery work stream, and a delivery work stream. The strategy stream guides the discovery stream. The discovery stream guides the delivery stream, and then the delivery stream informs the discovery stream, and the discovery stream informs the strategy stream.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Rather than seeing strategy, discovery, and delivery as separate phases, Roman suggests visualizing them as parallel work streams that continuously inform and guide each other.\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  This approach recognizes that strategy work doesn't just happen at the beginning\u2014it continues throughout the product lifecycle, adapting as the product evolves. By integrating these work streams and ensuring they're interconnected through feedback loops, teams can create a more cohesive and effective product development process.</p>   The Power of Collaboration <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"The important thing is to make sure that the different areas of work are not disjointed but interlinked. A key element to make that work is to use collaboration and teamwork and ensure that there aren't any handoffs, or avoid handoffs as much as possible.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Collaboration and teamwork are essential to successfully integrating strategy, discovery, and delivery. Roman emphasizes the importance of bringing product people\u2014who understand customer needs, business models, and stakeholder relationships\u2014together with tech teams to foster innovation and create value. This collaborative approach helps overcome the challenges that arise from treating these activities as separate, sequential steps.</p>   Building an Extended Product Team <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Form a big product team, a product team that is empowered to make strategic decisions and consists not only of the person in charge of the product and maybe a UX designer and a software developer, but also key business stakeholders, maybe somebody from marketing, maybe somebody from sales, maybe a support team member.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Roman advocates for forming an extended product team that includes not just product managers, designers, and developers, but also key business stakeholders. This larger team can collectively own the product strategy and have holistic ownership of the product\u2014not just focusing on discovery or delivery. By empowering this extended team to make strategic decisions together, organizations can ensure that different perspectives and expertise inform the product development process.</p>   Practical Implementation: Bringing it all Together <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Have regular meetings. A specific recommendation that I like to make is to have quarterly strategy workshops as a rule of thumb, where the current product strategy is reviewed and adjusted, but also the current product roadmap is reviewed and adapted.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Implementing this integrated approach requires practical mechanisms for collaboration. Roman recommends holding quarterly strategy workshops to review and adjust the product strategy and roadmap, ensuring they stay in sync with insights from development work. Additionally, he suggests that members of the extended product team should attend monthly operational meetings, such as sprint reviews, to maintain a complete understanding of what's happening with the product at both strategic and tactical levels.</p>   Moving Beyond Sequential Thinking <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Unfortunately, our software industry has a tendency to make things structured, linear, and assign ownership of different phases to different people. This usually leads to bigger problems like missing information, problems discovered too late that affect 'strategy', but need to be addressed in 'delivery'.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  One of the challenges in adopting a more integrated approach is overcoming the industry's tendency toward linear, sequential thinking. Roman and Vasco discuss how this mindset can lead to issues being discovered too late in the process, after strategic decisions have already been made. By embracing a more iterative, interconnected approach, teams can address problems more effectively and adapt their strategy based on insights from discovery and delivery.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">  About Roman Pichler</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Roman Pichler is a leading product management expert specializing in product strategy, leadership, and agility.
