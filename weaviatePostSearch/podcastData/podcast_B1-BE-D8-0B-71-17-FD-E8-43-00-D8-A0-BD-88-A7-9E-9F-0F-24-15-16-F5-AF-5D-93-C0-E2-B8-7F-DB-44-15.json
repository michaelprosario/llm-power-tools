    "Description": "<p>The pandemic has accelerated the move to the cloud - but it's not the only reason to migrate. Richard talks to Sonia Cuff about the effects of the pandemic on business transformation. Sonia talks about the response to the pandemic, such as working-from-home and moving to the cloud, as an adaptation to the crisis: Not transformation. The transformation part comes later, as you dig deeper into the new world the pandemic has brought you to. Can you go beyond surviving, and actually thrive?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/covid-19-didnt-lead-your-digital-transformation-sonia-cuff/\">COVID-19 Did Not Lead Your Digital Transformation</a></li></ul>\n",
