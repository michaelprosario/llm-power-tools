    "Description": "<p>Today, Million+ follower, TikTok teacher, and creator of #TeacherTipTuesday, Megan Mayer, shares her thoughts about TikTok, how to prevent profanity on TikTok and why it is a valuable tool for teachers. Megan talks openly about what she\u2019s learned about her videos that have gone viral, how to pick hashtags, and secrets for making videos that will help teachers.

The episode Mayer appeared in portrayed the struggles of teaching from home during the covid lockdown and included situations like Zooming into class from her bathroom and doing a parent-teacher conference in her closet. Untraditional? Sure. But during the pandemic, teachers did everything they could to be there for students and families. And, anyway, the view of Mayer captured in the CBS show would have been familiar to anyone who watched with her popular ongoing TikTok series <a href= \"https://www.tiktok.com/@thecrazycreativeteacher/video/7059741760876186927?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\"> \"Teacher Tip Tuesday.\"</a> Two years later, a lot more people have checked in with the series\u2014Mayer now has more than 1.2 million followers.</p> <p>Mayer\u2019s TikToks offer unique insights into the life of a teacher. Another is projects from her middle-school language arts classroom, which often feature the use of a <a href=\"https://cricut.com/en_us\">Cricut print-and-cut machine</a>. Those videos got the attention of the company, which offered her a sponsorship. (Cricut is part of a growing number of brands interested in working with Mayer.) The money from that relationship circulates back into the classroom. As a <a href= \"https://fgcu360.com/2021/07/13/alums-tiktoks-inspire-fellow-teachers-attract-following/\"> Florida Gulf Coast University profile noted</a>, \"Like many educators, [Mayer] ends up spending her own money on classroom amenities like parties, prizes and d\u00e9cor to enhance the learning environment for her exceptional-education students.\"</p> <p>Source of Bio: <a href= \"https://elective.collegeboard.org/tiktok-famous-teachers-everyone-should-follow\"> https://elective.collegeboard.org/tiktok-famous-teachers-everyone-should-follow</a></p> <p><em>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
