    "Description": "When Evan read an article about the rate of suicide among veterans returning from war, it broke his heart. So he decided to turn that heart break into advocacy. He read about and researched the experiences of vets and created a game designed to share theirs stories with the world. Evan tells us about his process, why games have a special power to create empathy and activate, and what he hopes for the future of games with a purpose. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
