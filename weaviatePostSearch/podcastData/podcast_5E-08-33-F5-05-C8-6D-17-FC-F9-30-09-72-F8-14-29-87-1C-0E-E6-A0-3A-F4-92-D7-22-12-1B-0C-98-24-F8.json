    "Description": "<p>When Seth Berkowitz was in college, he was the cookie guy on campus. He\u2019d grown frustrated that the only food he could get delivered late at night were standards like pizza or Chinese food. He had a sweet tooth, and he craved warm, homemade chocolate chip cookies. So he took matters into his own hands and started making and delivering cookies to students at his school. The operation soon went from a silly side hustle to a real business - and then an all-consuming struggle. But today, after decades of detours, long-shot decisions, and near-bankruptcies, Insomnia Cookies is now a $350 million dollar business.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
