    "Description": "<p>Today I'm talking with Sean Smith, one of freeCodeCamp's earliest graduates. Sean's also a prolific open source contributor, having helped develop freeCodeCamp's original React curriculum.</p> <p>Sean grew up in Tenessee and was an avid outdoorsman and rock climber. He went to college hoping to become a doctor. He even interned at the National Institutes of Health and published in the Journal of Virology.</p> <p>But one day he decided to leave the field \u2013 with no clear plans for the future \u2013 Leaving his friends and family puzzled.</p> <p>For two years, Sean worked at climbing gyms across Tenessee as a route setter, climbing the walls and installing climbing holds. And one day he decided he needed to learn to code.</p> <p>I caught up with Sean in downtown San Francisco, in a caf\u00e9 that both he and I had coincidentally worked out of early in our developer careers.</p> <p>I learned a lot about Sean's journey into tech that took him from working in San Francisco to Singapore to Taipei.</p> <p>And spoiler alert: during the podcast we talk about Sean's job search. I'm happy to report that since I interviewed him last month, he's landed a developer job at a company focused on AI and e-commerce.</p> <p> If you dig this podcast, be sure to leave us a review. I'm excited to read any feedback you have for me. And tell your friends. It really helps us inspire more people.</p> <p>Sean Smith on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmatthewsmith/</p>",
