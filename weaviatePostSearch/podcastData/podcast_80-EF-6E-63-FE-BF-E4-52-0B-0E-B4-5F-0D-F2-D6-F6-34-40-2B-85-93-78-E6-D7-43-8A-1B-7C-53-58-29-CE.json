    "Description": "<p>Another year of doing more with less? While at Ignite in Seattle, Richard sat down with Erin Chapple to talk about her work on Azure Infrastructure and the challenges around the cloud - more instances of everything, more to manage, more to pay attention to. And yet, budgets are not increasing! Erin talks about improving utilization within the cloud and broadening monitoring to cover everything you care about on-premises or on any cloud. And then there are the new copilots. Work to set up? Perhaps. But Azure Copilot can help you understand what's happening in your Azure tenant and how to utilize it more effectively. You can do more with less!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products/copilot\">Azure Copilot</a></li></ul><p>Recorded November 16, 2023</p>\n",
