    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with data scientist Ayodele Odubela. You will hear how and why she chose to do a Masters in Data Science and supplemented that with online education. You will also hear about self-discovery, fortitude and passion, and how she got one of her data science jobs through Twitter. You will learn about some of Ayodele's projects like using SVM for detecting poisonous vs. edible mushrooms, using random forests and decision trees for ranking wines based on the chemical contents, using the Naive Bayes to detect spam. You will learn about the real-world project that she's worked on, bullet stopping flying drones. You will find out what role machine learning played in that project and how they're going to be applied in society once they get rolled out.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/297\">www.superdatascience.com/297</a></p>\n      ",
