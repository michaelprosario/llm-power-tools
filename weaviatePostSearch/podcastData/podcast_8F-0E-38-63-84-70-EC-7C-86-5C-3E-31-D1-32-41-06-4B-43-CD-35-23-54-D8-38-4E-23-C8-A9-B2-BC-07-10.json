    "Description": "<p>Your developers want to do some DevOps - what does it mean to you? Richard chats with Tim Warner about what operations needs to care about and learn when the organization wants to roll out software faster. DevOps is an umbrella term for a lot of different technical changes, but also procedural and culture changes too. Tim hits on the key points for operations folks, including understanding source control (and learning to value it), automating all the things, and being able to get to a known reliable state. Better systems faster!</p>\n",
