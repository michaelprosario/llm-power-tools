    "Description": "<p>AI professor Jeff Clune ruminates on open-ended evolutionary algorithms\u2014systems designed to generate novel and interesting outcomes forever. Drawing inspiration from nature\u2019s boundless creativity, Clune and his collaborators aim to build \u201cDarwin Complete\u201d search spaces, where any computable environment can be simulated. By harnessing the power of large language models and reinforcement learning, these AI agents continuously develop new skills, explore uncharted domains, and even cooperate with one another in complex tasks.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>SPONSOR MESSAGES:</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>CentML offers competitive pricing for GenAI model deployment, with flexible options to suit a wide range of models, from small to large-scale deployments. </p>\n<p>https://centml.ai/pricing/</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Tufa AI Labs is a brand new research lab in Zurich started by Benjamin Crouzier focussed on reasoning and AGI. Are you interested in working on reasoning, or getting involved in their events? </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>They are hosting an event in Zurich on January 9th with the ARChitects, join if you can. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Goto https://tufalabs.ai/</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>A central theme throughout Clune\u2019s work is \u201cinterestingness\u201d: an elusive quality that nudges AI agents toward genuinely original discoveries. Rather than rely on narrowly defined metrics\u2014which often fail due to Goodhart\u2019s Law\u2014Clune employs language models to serve as proxies for human judgment. In doing so, he ensures that \u201cinteresting\u201d always reflects authentic novelty, opening the door to unending innovation. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Yet with these extraordinary possibilities come equally significant risks. Clune says we need AI safety measures\u2014particularly as the technology matures into powerful, open-ended forms. Potential pitfalls include agents inadvertently causing harm or malicious actors subverting AI\u2019s capabilities for destructive ends. To mitigate this, Clune advocates for prudent governance involving democratic coalitions, regulation of cutting-edge models, and global alignment protocols. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Jeff Clune: </p>\n<p>https://x.com/jeffclune</p>\n<p>http://jeffclune.com/</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(Interviewer: Tim Scarfe)</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>1.
