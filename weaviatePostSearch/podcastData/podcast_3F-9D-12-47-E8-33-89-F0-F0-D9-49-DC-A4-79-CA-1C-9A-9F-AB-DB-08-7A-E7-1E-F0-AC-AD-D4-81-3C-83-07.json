However, he discovered that collaboration in construction isn't about boss relationships\u2014it's about people coming together to deliver value from the customer's perspective. The key insight: when multiple contractors compete for their share of income, the real goal becomes finding ways to complete \"the work\" efficiently. Competition exists, but the ultimate focus must remain on delivering what the customer truly needs, not just what individual trades want to accomplish.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to the concept of an <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)\"> Andon Cord</a>, and <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.leanblog.org/2009/07/swarming-for-improvement/\"> Swarming from Lean</a>.</p>   Featured Book of the Week: The Machine That Changed the World & The Toyota Way <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  These two books provided Luca with his \"aha!\" moment in understanding Lean construction. <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/43MSPRA\"> The Toyota Way</a>, available in both English and <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.amazon.it/principi-rinascita-industriale-italiano-italiani/dp/8820359979/\">  Italian (with additional Italian company case studies),</a>  initially created a culture shock as Luca struggled to apply automotive methods to construction's one-off projects. However, these books revealed how Lean thinking could transform construction through visual management to surface problems quickly and swarming practices to fix issues faster. The books taught him that Lean principles transcend industries when properly adapted to different contexts.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/43ZK3Rv\"> The Machine That Changed The World, by Womack, Jones, and Roos</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  What industry practices have you dismissed too quickly without considering how they might adapt to your unique context?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
