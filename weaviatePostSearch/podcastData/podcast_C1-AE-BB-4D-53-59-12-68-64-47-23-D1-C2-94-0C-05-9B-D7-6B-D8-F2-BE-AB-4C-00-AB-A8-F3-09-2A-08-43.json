    "Description": "<p>What can the financial services sector teach us about adopting Copilot in our organizations? Richard chats with Christina Wheeler about her work at Microsoft, where she helps companies leverage large language model technologies. Christina discusses data security, which is crucial in the financial services industry due to its numerous regulations. The data security mindset of using tools like Purview and Data Loss Prevention helps to carve out data sets that can be used with Copilot. The conversation also turns to the Power Platform arena and Dataverse, tools that make it easy to embrace Copilot. There's a progression of security and capability, from internal apps to assisting staff with online work, to ultimately providing a means for customers to interact with a Copilot. There's a lot to learn, but the tools are there to make it possible!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/purview?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Microsoft Purview</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Power Platform Data Loss Prevention</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/powervirtualagents?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Power Virtual Agents</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/dataverse\">Microsoft Dataverse</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio\">Copilot Studio</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry\">Azure AI Foundry</a></li></ul><p>Recorded July 7, 2025</p>\n",
