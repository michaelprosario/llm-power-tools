    "Description": "<p>Welcome to today's episode, where I will bridge the gap between AI in my classroom and your ears! If you've been following my blog, you know I want to bring practical, innovative teaching strategies to life. But today, I'm doing things a bit differently on the show for an extended episode with me, your host, Vicki Davis.</p> <p><em>Sponsor: Modern Classrooms Project will help you bring engaging, exciting teaching to your classroom with their free online course and community. Go to <a href= \"https://learn.modernclassrooms.org/?utm_source=coolcat&utm_medium=paid-advertising&utm_campaign=fall23-recruitment\"> coolcatteacher.com/modern</a> right now to sign up for the Modern Classrooms essential course for free where you will learn about the strategies, research, and resources that can drive student-centered, self-directed learning in your classroom. They can show you have to use technology to unlock deeper student relationships with your students. So many people ask me how to respond to Artificial Intelligence and my response is always, that we need to shift our pedagogical practices into the classroom to the time-tested research-based best practices. You get that with Modern Classrooms, so go to <a href= \"https://learn.modernclassrooms.org/?utm_source=coolcat&utm_medium=paid-advertising&utm_campaign=fall23-recruitment\"> coolcatteacher.com/modern</a> today and sign up. You\u2019ll be glad you did.</em></p> <p>I'll guide you through how I use AI in my classes. I teach eighth grade through an AP Class with seniors, and we're finding amazing ways to use AI, from advising us on a trip project to providing feedback on logos and user interfaces for our app-building project to testing AI tutors. It's all real and all right now. There is no theory here, just lots of learning and some bumps along the way. <em>(Recently, a custom GPT I created started calling me Melissa, sigh. Someone explain that to me!)</em></p> <p>And for a bit of fun, meet CAT GPT, my very own Content AI Taskhelper - a personal assistant I've created with a blend of my own educational beliefs and research-backed best practices. I have it interview me on the way to school (and sometimes back), and it helps me create content for you. I always link to it, so I'll share how I do that too.</p> <p>And, since I've given two weeks off to my son, John, so he can ace his finals, I understand the frustration with AI-generated transcripts (thanks, southern accent!), so while there's o polished transcript available just yet, you can check out the auto-captions on the Cool Cat Teacher YouTube channel for a pretty good transcript. And if you need a more accurate version, don't hesitate to reach out via email -- I'm committed to making my content accessible to all.</p> <p>This episode is more than just a podcast; it's a glimpse into the future of education with AI. So whether you're a seasoned educator or just AI-curious, tune in, laugh along, and prepare to form your own opinions about AI. Let's continue this AI adventure together as we work to improve our classrooms and educate a successful generation for tomorrow.</p> <p>This extended episode sponsored by Modern Classrooms will help me share about the pedagogical changes that can happen in schools that want to advance learning in an AGE of AI.</p>",
