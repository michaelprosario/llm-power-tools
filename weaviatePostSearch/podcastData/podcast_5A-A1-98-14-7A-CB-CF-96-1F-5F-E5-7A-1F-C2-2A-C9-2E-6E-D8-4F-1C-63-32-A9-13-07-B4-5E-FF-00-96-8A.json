    "Description": "  Stuart Tipples: Silent Teams, Explosive Outcomes\u2014Learning to Normalize Disagreement <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Stuart tells the story of a team he was brought in to coach that appeared functional on the surface but was struggling beneath. Despite being behind on critical work, the team maintained a facade of happiness while abandoning retrospectives and falling into hero culture patterns. The team had developed \"toxic positivity\" where members stayed silent about real issues, creating an environment without psychological safety. When problems finally surfaced, the team exploded into unpleasant disagreements. Stuart's key learning: teams usually stay silent until it's too late, making it crucial to foster psychological safety by normalizing disagreement and creating space for honest dialogue.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  Is your team comfortable with healthy disagreement, or are you maintaining a facade of toxic positivity that prevents real issues from being addressed?</p>   Featured Book of the Week: Trust Based Leadership by Mike Ettore <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/43O2Jnj\"> Trust Based Leadership by Mike Ettore</a>  stands out because it's devoid of corporate fluff and delivers a clear message from a former marine turned executive. Stuart recommends it because it focuses on the fundamental truth that if you don't build trust, you're just managing compliance. The book emphasizes leading with consistency, clarity, and courage, and encourages leaders not to wait for permission to make positive changes. It's a practical guide that moves beyond typical corporate leadership advice to address real-world leadership challenges.</p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\ude80 Global Agile Summit 2025</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Join us in  Tallinn, Estonia, from  May 18th \u2013 20th, 2025, for an event that will inspire, challenge, and equip you with  real-world Agile success stories.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83c\udf0d Connect with global Agile leaders.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udca1 Learn practical strategies for impact.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udd25 Break free from Agile fatigue and become a Pragmatic Innovator</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/the-global-agile-summit-program/?utm_source=e1125_3_smtp\">  Check Full Program</a></p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Stuart Tipples\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Stuart is an Agilista, a coach, Scrum Master, agile delivery.
