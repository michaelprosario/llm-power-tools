Students just turn in work.</p> <p>Then, the teacher has the paper analyzed by Urkund. The Urkund system is highly accurate, cost-effective, and even better, doesn\u2019t sell licenses to students or others. Just teachers can use the power of Urkund. So, if you use another text similarity detection tool, or if you haven\u2019t used one yet, now is the time to start your free trial at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/detect\">www.coolcatteacher.com/detect</a> \u00a0and learn more about Urkund today.</p> From \"The Vault\" of the 10-Minute Teacher Podcast <p>Lisa Scumpieru's show aired in 2017 and remains a highly shared resource on hyperdocs. Simply put, this is a show you can share with teachers to help them get started that explains simply how it works. If a teacher is using Google Classroom, they need to use hyperdocs.</p> <p>This is one of the top shows of the 10-Minute Teacher of all time. Since iTunes keeps only 295 of the 500 shows, we wanted to take some of the very best of the show this summer and re-share it with our growing community of remarkable educators. Enjoy!\u00a0</p> Lisa Scumpieru - Bio As Submitted <p>\u00a0I have taught for 23 years at North Hagerstown High School in Hagerstown, Md. I am originally from north of Pittsburgh. I have always looked at myself as a life-long learner and Twitter has helped me strengthen my PLN and my teaching. I am a Google Certified Trainer, Flipgrid Ambassador, Formative Educator, and CommonLit Advisory Board Member. Our school is 1:1 with I-pads and I am incorporating a lot of project-based learning, hyperdocs, and diverse seating. I am a fan of not teaching the entire book, but giving students the meat of the text and reading Shakespeare from the middle. My inspirations are: Matt Miller\u2019s \u201cDitch the Textbook\u201d, Dave Burgess\u2019 \u201cTeach Like a Pirate\u201d, and Joy Kirr\u2019s \u201cShift This\u201d. I love to share my work and help others improve their teaching.</p>",
