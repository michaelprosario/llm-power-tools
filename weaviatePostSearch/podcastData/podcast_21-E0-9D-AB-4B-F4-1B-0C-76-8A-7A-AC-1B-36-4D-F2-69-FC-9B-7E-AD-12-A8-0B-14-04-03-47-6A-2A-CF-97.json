    "Description": "<p>Did you know the Python Software Foundation is hiring! With the recent support of three Visionary Sponsors, the PSF has been able to open positions for a developer-in-residence and a Python packaging project manager. Real Python now has a monthly Python news article. Frequent guest of the show, David Amos compiles and summarizes the biggest Python news from the past month.</p>\n<p>This week on the show, David Amos is back, and he&rsquo;s brought another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects. We discuss David&rsquo;s news article from the last month. We also discuss previous guest Jon Fincher&rsquo;s new step-by-step tutorial about creating a platform game with the arcade framework. </p>\n<p>We cover several other articles and projects from the Python community including, how to use ipywidgets to make your Jupyter notebook interactive, the hidden performance overhead of Python C extensions, adding else to for loops, film simulations from scratch using Python, a gradual programming language named Hedy, and a Python raytracer.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/\">CPython Internals: Your Guide to the Python 3 Interpreter</a></p>\n<p>Unlock the Inner Workings of the Python Language, Compile the Python Interpreter From Source  Code,\nAnd Participate in the Development of CPython</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:02:04 &ndash; How to Use ipywidgets to Make Your Jupyter Notebook Interactive </li>\n<li>00:06:07 &ndash; Build a Platform Game in Python With arcade </li>\n<li>00:12:35 &ndash; Sponsor: Digital Ocean&rsquo;s App Platform</li>\n<li>00:13:11 &ndash; The Hidden Performance Overhead of Python C Extensions</li>\n<li>00:21:17 &ndash; For-Else: A Weird but Useful Feature in Python</li>\n<li>00:25:42 &ndash; Python News: What&rsquo;s New From April 2021?</li>\n<li>00:39:43 &ndash; Spotlight: CPython Internals Now in Paperback!</li>\n<li>00:41:15 &ndash; Film Simulations From Scratch Using Python</li>\n<li>00:47:44 &ndash; hedy: Hedy Is a Gradual Programming Language, Which Increases in Syntactic Elements Level by Level</li>\n<li>00:50:27 &ndash; Python-Raytracer: A Basic Ray Tracer That Exploits NumPy Arrays and Functions to Work Fast</li>\n<li>00:53:31 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wrighters.io/use-ipywidgets-with-jupyter-notebooks/\">How to Use ipywidgets to Make Your Jupyter Notebook Interactive</a> &ndash; Jupyter Notebooks are great for exploratory data analysis. They&rsquo;re also a good way to share results and analysis with other people, who can alter the notebook to further explore the data themselves. But there are some limitations to notebook interactivity. That&rsquo;s where <code>ipywidgets</code> comes in! In this tutorial you&rsquo;ll learn how to create widgets like check boxes, drop-down menus, sliders, and how to handle events like button clicks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/platformer-python-arcade/\">Build a Platform Game in Python With arcade</a> &ndash; Building games can be a fun way to learn new Python concepts and practice techniques you&rsquo;ve already learned. Plus, they make for great projects to share! This step-by-step tutorial shows you how to build a platform game using the <code>arcade</code> library. You&rsquo;ll learn techniques for designing levels, sourcing assets, and implementing advanced features</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-extension-performance/\">The Hidden Performance Overhead of Python C Extensions</a> &ndash; It&rsquo;s no secret that Python is slower than compiled languages like C, C++, and Rust. If you need a performance boost, you can write compiled Python C extensions. But there are some hidden performance costs that you should be aware of if you decide to do this. This article explains two ways that Python C extensions can actually be slower than pure Python and discusses some solutions and work around for them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techtofreedom/for-else-a-weird-but-useful-feature-in-python-2076d8dafad1\">For-Else: A Weird but Useful Feature in Python</a> &ndash; Python <code>for</code> loops have an unusual feature: they support an <code>else</code> block that only executes if there is no break in the loop. The pattern isn&rsquo;t used very often with the argument against it being that it is a bit weird and potentially difficult to understand. But there may be times when <code>for/else</code> makes sense. This article presents three situations where <code>for/else</code> is useful and argues that, in these situations, the pattern makes the code more readable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-news-april-2021/\">Python News: What&rsquo;s New From April 2021?</a> &ndash; April 2021 was an eventful month in the world of Python. In this article, you&rsquo;ll get up to speed on everything that happened in the past month, including new sponsorships for the PSF, changes to Python error messages, and a community-led discussion over the future of type annotations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kevinmartinjose.com/2021/04/27/film-simulations-from-scratch-using-python/\">Film Simulations From Scratch Using Python</a> &ndash; In analog photography, you can achieve different &ldquo;looks&rdquo; for your photographs by selecting different kinds of film to shoot with. Digital camera manufacturers often include different presets to simulate different kinds of film. In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how to simulate different films on your own images using <strong>color lookup tables</strong>, or <strong>CLUT</strong>s, using NumPy and the Pillow image library.</p>\n<p>Projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/felienne/hedy\">hedy: Hedy Is a Gradual Programming Language, Which Increases in Syntactic Elements Level by Level</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Python-Raytracer\">Python-Raytracer: A Basic Ray Tracer That Exploits NumPy Arrays and Functions to Work Fast</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arcade.academy/index.html\">The Python Arcade Library</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/\">Arcade: A Primer on the Python Game Framework</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kenney.nl/\">Kenney: Free game assets, no strings attached</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mapeditor.org/\">Tiled: Free and Open Source, Flexible Level Editor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/\">Episode 24: Options for Packaging Your Python Application: Wheels, Docker, and More</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/postmortemgirl/status/1270679779335794688?s=20\">Your Code Is Without a Doubt the Worst I Have Ever Run</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html\">Welcoming Google as a Visionary Sponsor of the PSF</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/\">Welcoming Microsoft as a Visionary Sponsor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/jobs/5317/\">Python Job Board: Project Manager - Python Packaging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/\">PEP 563 &ndash; Postponed Evaluation of Annotations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/45/\">Episode 45: Processing Images in Python With Pillow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rawtherapee.com/\">RawTherapee: A free, cross-platform raw image processing program</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Level up your Python skills with our expert-led courses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/using-jupyter-notebooks/\">Using Jupyter Notebooks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-for-loop/\">For Loops in Python (Definite Iteration)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/pygame-primer/\">Make a 2D Side-Scroller Game With PyGame</a></li>\n</ul> <p><a rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://realpython.com/join\">Support the podcast &amp; join our community of Pythonistas</a></p>",
