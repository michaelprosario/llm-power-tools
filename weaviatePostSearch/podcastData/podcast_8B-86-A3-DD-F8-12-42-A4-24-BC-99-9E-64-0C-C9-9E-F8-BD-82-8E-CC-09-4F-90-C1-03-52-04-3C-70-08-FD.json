Suzanne Cresswell shares the neuroscience behind student's need for movement.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://coolcatteacher.com/e664\">coolcatteacher.com/e664</a></p> <p class=\"p1\">Sponsor: In today\u2019s challenging times, we know how critical it is to make sure kids are equipped with social and emotional learning skills to cope with the world around them. That's why I\u2019m excited to highlight the <a href= \"https://www.we.org/en-US/our-work/we-schools/sel/\">WE Schools Program</a>, made possible by The Allstate Foundation.
