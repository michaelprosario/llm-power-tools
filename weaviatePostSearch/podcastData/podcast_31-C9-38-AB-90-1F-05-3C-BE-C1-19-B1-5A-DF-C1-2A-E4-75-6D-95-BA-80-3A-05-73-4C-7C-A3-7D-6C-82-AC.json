He is the Director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts and the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology. His research focuses on understanding the biophysical mechanisms of pattern regulation and harnessing endogenous bioelectric dynamics for rational control of growth and form.</p>\n<p>The capacity to generate a complex, behaving organism from the single cell of a fertilized egg is one of the most amazing aspects of biology. Levin' lab integrates approaches from developmental biology, computer science, and cognitive science to investigate the emergence of form and function. Using biophysical and computational modeling approaches, they seek to understand the collective intelligence of cells, as they navigate physiological, transcriptional, morphognetic, and behavioral spaces. They develop conceptual frameworks for basal cognition and diverse intelligence, including synthetic organisms and AI.</p>\n<p>Also joining us this evening is Irina Rish. Irina is a Full Professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's Computer Science and Operations Research department, a core member of Mila - Quebec AI Institute, as well as the holder of the Canada CIFAR AI Chair and the Canadian Excellence Research Chair in Autonomous AI. She has a PhD in AI from UC Irvine. Her research focuses on machine learning, neural data analysis, neuroscience-inspired AI, continual lifelong learning, optimization algorithms, sparse modelling, probabilistic inference, dialog generation, biologically plausible reinforcement learning, and dynamical systems approaches to brain imaging analysis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Interviewer: Dr. Tim Scarfe</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>[00:00:00] Introduction</p>\n<p>[00:02:09] Emergence</p>\n<p>[00:13:16] Scaling Laws</p>\n<p>[00:23:12] Intelligence</p>\n<p>[00:44:36] Transhumanism</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Prof. Michael Levin</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levin_(biologist)</p>\n<p>https://www.drmichaellevin.org/</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/drmichaellevin</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Prof. Irina Rish</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/irinarish</p>\n<p>https://irina-rish.com/</p>\n",
