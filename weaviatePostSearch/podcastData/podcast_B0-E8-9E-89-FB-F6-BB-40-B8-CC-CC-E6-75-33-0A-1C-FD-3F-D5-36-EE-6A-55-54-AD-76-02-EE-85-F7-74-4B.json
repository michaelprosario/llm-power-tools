    "Description": "<p>I met Michelle Moore at a Women in Tech &amp; Entrepreneurship networking event in 2023. She shared a story about how she came from Canada and was looking for a group that helped women in tech become more confident in their knowledge. She is a natural storyteller and listeners you won\u2019t be disappointed. Tune in to hear her story how she initially wanted to be a spy, why she changed her mind, switched her career path, and embraced cultural diversity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of her favorite authors, Arwana Hayashi (The Art of a True Move) shared \u00a0\"The body is our primary way of knowing and being in the world. Through the body, we can access deeper levels of awareness and insight. Michelle mentioned Cal Newport\u2019s book, Slow Productivity as a reminder to slow down and engage in the world rather than the speed of technology. This is definitely a book I will order.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When musing on what 2030 will be like, Michelle dropped a thought bomb on us. There will be a big desire to be device free because of the advancement and pace that technology is moving. There will be a demand for device free experiences. This will impact the job market to free people of the false sense of the dopamine pleasure and mindless scrolling that happens now. We need to be reminded that technology is designed to pull us away from others. In person experiences will be in demand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Michelle\u2019s mentoring advice to my listeners is \u201cLearn to listen to your gut; tap into your instincts and intelligence, or your Higher Power. Trust that voice that tells you truth.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Intern Whisperer Podcast is brought to you by Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
