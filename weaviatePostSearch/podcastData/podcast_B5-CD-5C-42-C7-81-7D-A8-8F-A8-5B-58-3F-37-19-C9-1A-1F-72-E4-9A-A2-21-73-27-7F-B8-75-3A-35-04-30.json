    "Description": "<p>This episode features Shlomi Fuchter and Jack Parker Holder from Google DeepMind, who are unveiling a new AI called Genie 3. The host, Tim Scarfe, describes it as the most mind-blowing technology he has ever seen. We were invited to their offices to conduct the interview (not sponsored).Imagine you could create a video game world just by describing it. That&#39;s what Genie 3 does. It&#39;s an AI &quot;world model&quot; that learns how the real world works by watching massive amounts of video. Unlike a normal video game engine (like Unreal or the one for Doom) that needs to be programmed manually, Genie generates a realistic, interactive, 3D world from a simple text prompt.**SPONSOR MESSAGES***Prolific: Quality data. From real people. For faster breakthroughs.https://prolific.com/mlst?utm_campaign=98404559-MLST&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=script-gen***Here\u2019s a breakdown of what makes it so revolutionary:From Text to a Virtual World: You can type &quot;a drone flying by a beautiful lake&quot; or &quot;a ski slope,&quot; and Genie 3 creates that world for you in about three seconds. You can then navigate and interact with it in real-time.It&#39;s Consistent: The worlds it creates have a reliable memory. If you look away from an object and then look back, it will still be there, just as it was. The guests explain that this consistency isn&#39;t explicitly programmed in; it&#39;s a surprising, &quot;emergent&quot; capability of the powerful AI model.A Huge Leap Forward: The previous version, Genie 2, was a major step, but it wasn&#39;t fast enough for real-time interaction and was much lower resolution. Genie 3 is 720p, interactive, and photorealistic, running smoothly for several minutes at a time.The Killer App - Training Robots: Beyond entertainment, the team sees Genie 3 as a game-changer for training AI. Instead of training a self-driving car or a robot in the real world (which is slow and dangerous), you can create infinite simulations. You can even prompt rare events to happen, like a deer running across the road, to teach an AI how to handle unexpected situations safely.The Future of Entertainment: this could lead to a &quot;YouTube version 2&quot; or a new form of VR, where users can create and explore endless, interconnected worlds together, like the experience machine from philosophy.While the technology is still a research prototype and not yet available to the public, it represents a monumental step towards creating true artificial worlds from the ground up.Jack Parker Holder [Research Scientist at Google DeepMind in the Open-Endedness Team]https://jparkerholder.github.io/Shlomi Fruchter [Research Director, Google DeepMind]https://shlomifruchter.github.io/TOC:[00:00:00] - Introduction: &quot;The Most Mind-Blowing Technology I&#39;ve Ever Seen&quot;[00:02:30] - The Evolution from Genie 1 to Genie 2[00:04:30] - Enter Genie 3: Photorealistic, Interactive Worlds from Text[00:07:00] - Promptable World Events &amp; Training Self-Driving Cars[00:14:21] - Guest Introductions: Shlomi Fuchter &amp; Jack Parker Holder[00:15:08] - Core Concepts: What is a &quot;World Model&quot;?[00:19:30] - The Challenge of Consistency in a Generated World[00:21:15] - Context: The Neural Network Doom Simulation[00:25:25] - How Do You Measure the Quality of a World Model?[00:28:09] - The Vision: Using Genie to Train Advanced Robots[00:32:21] - Open-Endedness: Human Skill and Prompting Creativity[00:38:15] - The Future: Is This the Next YouTube or VR?[00:42:18] - The Next Step: Multi-Agent Simulations[00:52:51] - Limitations: Thinking, Computation, and the Sim-to-Real Gap[00:58:07] - Conclusion &amp; The Future of Game EnginesREFS:World Models [David Ha, J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122POEThttps://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753[Akarsh Kumar, Jeff Clune, Joel Lehman, Kenneth O.
