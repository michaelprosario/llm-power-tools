    "Description": "\n        <p>In 2007, when James Hirschfeld got the idea to start an online invitation company, the first person he turned to for help was his older sister, Alexa. Together, they were inspired to create a brand that combined the ease of digital correspondence with the beauty of paper.</p><p>Along the way, the founders faced myriad challenges: convincing investors that people would pay for virtual paper, settling on the right business model, and\u2014worst of all-- the existential threat of Covid. 15 years after launch - Paperless Post has sent over 650 million invitations, and has even been parodied on Saturday Night Live.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei. It was edited by Neva Grant, with research by J.C Howard. Our engineers were Robert Rodriguez and James Willetts.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;and sign up for Guy's free newsletter at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guyraz.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guyraz.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
