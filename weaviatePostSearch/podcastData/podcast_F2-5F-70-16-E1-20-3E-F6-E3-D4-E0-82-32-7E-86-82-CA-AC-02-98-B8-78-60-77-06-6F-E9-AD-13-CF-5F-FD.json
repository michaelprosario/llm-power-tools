This PO acted as an ambassador, bridging the gap between the team and stakeholders. They knew when to step in and when to step back, allowing the team to contribute their ideas. This PO also helped the team focus by presenting clear objectives and guiding the team through challenges without micromanaging. Their ability to communicate and foster collaboration made them an excellent example of what a Product Owner should strive to be.</p>   The Bad Product Owner: Overwhelmed and Isolated <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In contrast, Dominika highlights a negative Product Owner pattern where the PO tried to take on too much by themselves. Lacking a holistic view of their role, this PO attempted to manage everything alone, making decisions without team input and feeling overwhelmed as a result. This led to a lack of team collaboration, with the team feeling unappreciated and their feedback ignored. The PO, in this case, failed to justify or validate their decisions, leading to disengagement and frustration for both the PO and the team.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question: Are you fostering collaboration as a Product Owner, or are you trying to manage everything on your own?
