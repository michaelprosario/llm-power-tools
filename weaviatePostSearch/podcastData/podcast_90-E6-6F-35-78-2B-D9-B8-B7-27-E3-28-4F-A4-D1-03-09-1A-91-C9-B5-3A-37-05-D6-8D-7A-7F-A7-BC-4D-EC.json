    "Description": "Chris\u2019s job sounds impressive. After over a decade working in tech, he\u2019s designed microprocessors and now helps build robot vacuum cleaners. He\u2019s at the intersection of hardware and software in a space called embedded systems. We explore this field, get a solid intro to working with chips, and discuss the many ways a codenewbie can start learning more about the fascinating world of embedded systems.
