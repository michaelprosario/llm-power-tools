Preece - Bio As Submitted <p>MY BACKGROUND I am a high school chemistry teacher and have been for seven beautiful years, now. Using facilitated diffusion, knowledge was beaten into my fertile mind at Morehead State University and the University of Kentucky granting me the power of holding a piece of paper that says:\u00a0Bachelor's of Science in Chemistry at Morehead State University as well as a Master's of Arts in Teaching. In addition, I have taken 30+ graduate chemistry and education hours from the University of Kentucky in the pursuit of a Ph.D. in S.T.E.M. Education. Along with teaching and grad school, I write! My first publication was in July 2017 with <a href= \"https://amzn.to/33jFvUy\">CheMystery!</a> A graphic novel aimed at providing quality chemistry knowledge through the lens of superheroes. Also, I do science consulting. I have had the pleasure of assisting Frank Barbiere, Greg Rucka and the creators of Doctor Puppet on projects.</p> <p>MY PASSION Teaching, science and reading comics! I love comics of all kinds but the ones that truly win my heart are comics with great characters and even greater science. This medium is a great way to communicate many ideas and since science is so graphic, I think it can be a beautiful marriage when done right. Here are some of my favorite characters: Marvel- Captain America/Black Bolt DC- Firestorm Indy- Dr. Solar</p> <p>PANELS on Science in Comics +\u00a0Lexington Comic Con 2015\u00a0with Bob Hall and Kody Chamberlain +\u00a0D.C.'s Awesome Con 2015\u00a0with Duncan Rouleau and Tom King +\u00a0Baltimore Comic Con 2015\u00a0with Mark Waid and Ramona Fradon +\u00a0Lexington Comic Con 2016\u00a0with Matt Hawkins and Nathan Fox +\u00a0Indiana Comic Con 2016\u00a0with Neal Adams\u200b +\u00a0Lexington Comic Con 2017 +\u00a0Heroes Con 2017\u00a0with Josh Reynolds, Shari Brady, and Matt Brady +\u00a0KSTA Conference 2017\u00a0on Using Science Comics in the Classroom with Josh Woodward +\u00a0Derby City Comic Con 2017\u00a0with Megan Scholar +\u00a0Lexington Comic Con 2018\u00a0with Jim Shooter and Erica Schultz + ConGlomeration 2018 + Indy Pop Con 2018</p> <p>Blog: <a href= \"http://atomicuniverse.org/index.html\">http://atomicuniverse.org/index.html</a></p> <p>Twitter: @<a href= \"https://www.twitter.com/AtomicUniverse\">AtomicUniverse</a></p> <p>Instagram: @<a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/Atomic_Universe\">Atomic_Universe</a></p> <p>Kickstarter: Fire!
