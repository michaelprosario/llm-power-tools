    "Description": "<p>Melissa Binde, VP Engineering, Cloud @ Splunk, shares lessons from her time building Amazon Apollo. You\u2019ll hear the origin story of Amazon Apollo, how to define the right problem, identify the right solution, and what makes technology endure 20+ years. Plus how to improve your engineering storytelling and pitch the right product features to the right stakeholders!</p><p><i>\"We were heavily influenced by an early project manager I worked with who called it, the 'JEDI principle' - You make just enough decisions to implement! And so anytime we hit something. We would actually stop, if we were arguing, we'd stop and go, 'Well, wait, hang on. Do we actually have to decide this now? Or can we kick this down the road?' </i>And so that helped us avoid getting too tied up in philosophical arguments.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>ABOUT MELISSA BINDE</strong></p><p>Melissa Binde previously served as Splunk\u2019s VP of Platform and Observability.
