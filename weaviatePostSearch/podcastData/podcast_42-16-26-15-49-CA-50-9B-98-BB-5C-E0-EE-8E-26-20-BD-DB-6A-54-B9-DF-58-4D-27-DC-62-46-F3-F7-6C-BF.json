    "Description": "<p>When it comes to launching a multi-million dollar brand, Cynthia Tice was a late bloomer. Nearly 60 and looking for a healthy way to satisfy her love of chocolate, she set out to make an indulgent, sugar-free version, sweetened with stevia. After some disastrous early recipes, Lily\u2019s Sweets launched nationally in Whole Foods, with just four employees. Cynthia correctly predicted that a growing number of shoppers would willingly pay for healthier treats, and just ten years after launch, Lily\u2019s Sweets caught the eye of Hershey\u2019s, which acquired it for $425 million.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Sam Paulson with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
