    "Description": "<p>Jean Yang, founder of API observability company Akita Software, emphasizes that programming languages should be shaped by software development needs and data, rather than philosophical ideals. Yang, a former assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, believes that programming tools and processes should be influenced by actual use and data, prioritizing the developer experience over the language creator's beliefs. With a background in programming languages, Yang advocates for a shift away from the outdated notion that language developers are building solely for themselves.</p><p>In this discussion on The New Stack Makers, Yang underscores the importance of understanding the reality of developers' needs, especially as developer tools have evolved into a full-time industry. She argues for a focus on UX design and product fundamentals in developing tools, moving beyond the traditional mindset where developer tools were considered side projects.</p><p>Yang founded Akita to address the challenges of building reliable software systems in a world dominated by APIs and microservices. The company transitioned to API observability, recognizing the crucial role APIs play in enhancing the understandability of complex systems. Yang's commitment to improving software correctness and the belief in APIs as key to abstraction and ease of monitoring align with Postman's direction after acquiring Akita. Postman aims to serve developers worldwide, emphasizing the significance of APIs in complex systems.</p><p>Check out more episodes from The Tech Founder Odyssey series:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-byteboards-ceo-decided-to-fix-the-tech-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">How Byteboard\u2019s CEO Decided to Fix the Broken Tech Interview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/a-lifelong-maker-tackles-a-developer-onboarding-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">A Lifelong \u2018Maker\u2019 Tackles a Developer Onboarding Problem</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-teleports-leader-transitioned-from-engineer-to-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">How Teleport\u2019s Leader Transitioned from Engineer to CEO</a></p>\n",
