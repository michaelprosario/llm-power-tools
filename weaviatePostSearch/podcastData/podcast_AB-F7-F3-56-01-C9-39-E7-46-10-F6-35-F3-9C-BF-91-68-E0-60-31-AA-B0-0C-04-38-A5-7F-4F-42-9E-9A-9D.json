    "Description": "<p>What's the right way to have virtual desktops in the cloud? Richard talks to Aidan Finn about a virtualization project he was involved with that started with Citrix Cloud, which runs in Azure. Aidan talks about the number of virtual machines involved in a large-scale VDI implementation, many of which are infrastructure and plumbing. Why own the plumbing when you can get it as a service? The conversation then digs into Azure Virtual Desktop, which doesn't have all the bells and whistles of Citrix Cloud, but does simplify implementation a great deal. No virtualization implementation is ever simple, but working at the platform level can make it easier!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-cloud/\">Citrix Cloud</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/welcome-to-rds\">Remote Desktop Services</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop/\">Azure Virtual Desktop</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.packer.io/\">Packer</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/\">Azure Monitor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/image-builder/\">Azure VM Image Builder</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/\">MSIX</a></li></ul><p>Recorded September 9, 2021</p>\n",
