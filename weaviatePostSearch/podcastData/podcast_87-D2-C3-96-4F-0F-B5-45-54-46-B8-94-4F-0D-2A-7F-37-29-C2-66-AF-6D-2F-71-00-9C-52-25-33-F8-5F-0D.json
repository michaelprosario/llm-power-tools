    "Description": "Ashley Lewis used to light stages. She worked as a theater technician working shows like Hamilton (when it was much smaller) and New York Fashion Week. But after some introspection, she realized that her passion wasn\u2019t in light design, and she searched for other career options. She talks to us about the similarities between coding and her art background, what it\u2019s like working as a theater technician, and how being introspective has helped her on her coding journey.
