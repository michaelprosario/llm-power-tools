    "Description": "This episode is the long-awaited (and much requested) interview with <a href=\"http://swen.uwaterloo.ca/~kczarnec/\">Krzysztof Czarnecki</a>, the author, together with Ulrich Eisenecker, of the book  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Generative-Programming-Methods-Tools-Applications/dp/0201309777\">Generative Programming</a>.\n\nIn the interview we discussed the state of generative programming today and related it to model-driven development and DSLs. We then talked a little bit about product lines in general. We then discussed his current field of research, which currently focusses on framework-specific modeling languages and non-trivial roundtrip engineering.",
