    "Description": "<p>Observability in multi-cloud environments is becoming increasingly complex, as highlighted by Martin Mao, CEO and co-founder of Chronosphere. This challenge has two main components: a rise in customer-facing incidents, which demand significant engineering time for debugging, and the ineffectiveness and high cost of existing tools. These issues are creating a problematic return on investment for the industry.</p><p>Mao discussed these observability challenges on The New Stack Makers podcast with host Heather Joslyn, emphasizing the need to help teams prioritize alerts and encouraging a shift left approach for security responsibility among developers. With the adoption of distributed cloud architectures, organizations are not only dealing with a surge in data but also facing a cultural shift towards DevOps, where developers are expected to be more accountable for their software in production.</p><p>Historically, operations teams handled software in production, but in the cloud-native world, developers must take on these responsibilities themselves. Many current observability tools were designed for centralized operations teams, which creates a gap in addressing developer needs.</p><p>Mao suggests that cloud-native observability tools should empower developers to run and maintain their software in production, providing insights into the complex environments they work in. Moreover, observability tools can assist developers in understanding the intricacies of their software, such as its dependencies and operational aspects.</p><p>To streamline the data obtained from observability efforts and manage costs, Chronosphere introduced the \"Observability Data Optimization Cycle.\" This framework starts with establishing centralized governance to set budgets for teams generating data. The goal is to optimize data usage to extract value without incurring unnecessary costs. This approach applies financial operations (FinOps) concepts to the observability space, helping organizations tackle the challenges of cloud-native observability.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Observability and Chronosphere:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/observability/\">Observability Overview, News and Trends</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/4-key-observability-best-practices/\">4 Key Observability Best Practices</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/top-ways-to-reduce-your-observability-costs-part-1/\">Top Ways to Reduce Your Observability Costs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/top-4-factors-for-cloud-native-observability-tool-selection/\">Top 4 Factors for Cloud Native Observability Tool Selection</a></p>\n",
