    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Mark Minasi about Office 2010. Mark talks about his frustrations with Office (mostly Outlook). The conversation spends more time on PowerPoint than you would think possible, leading to talking about presentation style and value. Ultimately, this is a conversation about how people learn, and how folks like Mark can make that work better for you.</p>\n",
