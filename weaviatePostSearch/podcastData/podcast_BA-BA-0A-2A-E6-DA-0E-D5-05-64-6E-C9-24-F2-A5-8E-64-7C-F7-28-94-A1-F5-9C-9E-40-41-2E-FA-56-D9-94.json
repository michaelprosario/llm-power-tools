    "Description": "<p>Thomas Parr and his collaborators wrote a book titled &quot;Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain and Behavior&quot; which introduces Active Inference from both a high-level conceptual perspective and a low-level mechanistic, mathematical perspective.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Active inference, developed by the legendary neuroscientist Prof. Karl Friston - is a unifying mathematical framework which frames living systems as agents which minimize surprise and free energy in order to resist entropy and persist over time. It unifies various perspectives from physics, biology, statistics, and psychology - and allows us to explore deep questions about agency, biology, causality, modelling, and consciousness.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Buy Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior </p>\n<p>https://amzn.to/4dj0iMj</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>YT version: https://youtu.be/lbb-Si5wa_o</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Please support us on Patreon to get access to the private Discord server, bi-weekly calls, early access and ad-free listening. </p>\n<p>https://patreon.com/mlst</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Chapters should be embedded in the mp3, let me me know if issues</p>\n",
