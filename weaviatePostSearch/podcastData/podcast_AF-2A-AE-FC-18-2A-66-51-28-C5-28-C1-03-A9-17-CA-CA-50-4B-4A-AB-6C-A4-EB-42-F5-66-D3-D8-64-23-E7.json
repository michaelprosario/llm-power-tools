    "Description": "<p>Dr. Maxwell Ramstead grills Guillaume Verdon (AKA \u201cBeff Jezos\u201d) who&#39;s the founder of Thermodynamic computing startup Extropic.</p><p>***SPONSOR MESSAGE***</p><p>Google Gemini 2.5 Flash is a state-of-the-art language model in the Gemini app. Sign up at https://gemini.google.com</p><p>***</p><p>Guillaume shares his unique path \u2013 from dreaming about space travel as a kid to becoming a physicist, then working on quantum computing at Google, to developing a radically new form of computing hardware for machine learning. He explains how he hit roadblocks with traditional physics and computing, leading him to start his company \u2013 building &quot;thermodynamic computers.&quot; These are based on a new design for super-efficient chips that use the natural chaos of electrons (think noise and heat) to power AI tasks, which promises to speed up AND lower the costs of modern probabilistic techniques like sampling. He is driven by the pursuit of building computers that work more like your brain, which (by the way) runs on a banana and a glass of water!\u00a0</p><p>Guillaume talks about his alter ego, Beff Jezos, and the &quot;Effective Accelerationism&quot; (e/acc) movement that he initiated. Its objective is to speed up tech progress in order to \u201cgrow civilization\u201d (as measured by energy use and innovation), rather than \u201cslowing down out of fear\u201d. Guillaume argues we need to embrace variance, exploration, and optimism to avoid getting stuck or outpaced by competitors like China. He and Maxwell discuss big ideas like merging humans with AI, decentralizing intelligence, and why boundless growth (with smart constraints) is \u201ckey to humanity&#39;s future\u201d.</p><p>REFS:</p><p>1.
