From politics to technology to the job market, there have been a lot changes this year.</p> <p>Here at the EntreLeadership Podcast headquarters, that\u2019s incredible news. We LOVE change\u2014especially when it comes to helping you transform yourself and your business. It\u2019s like former British prime minister Winston Churchill once said, \u201cTo improve is to change, so to be perfect is to have changed often.\u201d</p> <p>With that in mind, 2017 was a banner year. Our guests focused on helping you get better in many areas. To make the most of their sage advice, we\u2019re closing out the year with clips from some of our favorite conversations. They were selected based on number of downloads and feedback from our listeners. We hope you enjoy them! Have a wonderful new year!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcasts/seth-godin-change-mind-change-life\"> Seth Godin\u2014Change Your Mind, Change Your Life</a></p> <p><strong>The Rundown:</strong>\u00a0Marketing master Seth Godin returns to the podcast for an in-depth conversation on change, from why we avoid it to how you can make it the number one weapon in your arsenal.</p> <p><strong>Top Takeaway:\u00a0</strong>Change creates an environment where you are not an expert. So if you don\u2019t like the feeling of incompetence, you\u2019ll fight the feeling of change. Getting comfortable with the feeling of being incompetent is one of the most important things you can do.\u00a0<strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong> \u201cThe only way to get better is to do things differently.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcasts/chris-barez-brown-escaping-life-autopilot\"> Chris Bar\u00e9z-Brown\u2014Escaping a Life on Autopilot</a></p> <p><strong>The Rundown:</strong>\u00a0It\u2019s been estimated that 50% of our time awake is spent on autopilot, leading to a life of missed moments and even less enjoyment at home and at work. Chris Bar\u00e9z-Brown is on a mission to help us escape that routine. The inspirational speaker, author and business beatnik joins us to share his tips on how to feel more conscious, joyful and inspired, and how to avoid missing what matters most.</p> <p><strong>Top Takeaway:\u00a0</strong>Want to break the cycle of running a hundred miles per hour all day\u2014spending all of your time putting out fires? Take a walk with someone for 7.5 minutes and talk it up while they listen. It gives you better perspective, insight, ideas and the ability to think differently about the future.</p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote: \u201cYou can\u2019t be a good creative leader unless you are a conscious leader.\u201d</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcasts/jocko-willink-discipline-advantage\"> Jocko Willink\u2014The Discipline Advantage</a></p> <p><strong>The Rundown:\u00a0</strong>A favorite of our listeners, retired Navy SEAL commander Jocko Willink returns to our Top 10 list for the second year in a row. Once upon a time, Willink traveled the world on military missions. These days, as a best-selling author and leadership coach, his work still takes him around the globe but to a much different battlefield. Jocko joins us to share his thoughts on developing leaders.</p> <p><strong>Top Takeaway:</strong>\u00a0If you want someone to step up into a leadership position, put them in one that\u2019s slightly out of their comfort zone and watch them rise to the occasion. This idea doesn\u2019t just work with your high-potential people; it works with your problem children who aren\u2019t performing or have a negative attitude.</p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote: \u201cIf you\u2019re the easy button for your team, they\u2019re going to get trained and conditioned to use that easy button. They are going to come to you for everything.\u201d</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcasts/jon-taffer-rescue-business\"> Jon Taffer\u2014Rescue Your Business</a></p> <p><strong>The Rundown:</strong>\u00a0When it comes to a struggling business, we\u2019ve heard pretty much every excuse in the book: a terrible economy, a bad location, an overcrowded marketplace. But\u00a0Jon Taffer\u00a0isn\u2019t buying it. The no-holds-barred star of Spike TV\u2019s hit show\u00a0<em>Bar Rescue</em>\u00a0explains why excuses are the common denominator of all failing businesses\u2014and exactly how to kick them to the curb for good.\u00a0<strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>Top Takeaway:\u00a0</strong>You don\u2019t have to spend a fortune with traditional advertising to market your business.

Your head is for developing ideas, not for holding them. Give yourself time to stop and reflect on how you\u2019re doing. Build in a thinking process. Take two hours a week to step back and check the inventory of what\u2019s going on.\u00a0<strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote: \u201cYour head is a crappy office to hold ideas.\u201d</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcasts/chris-voss-negotiating\"> Chris Voss\u2014Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It</a></p> <p><strong>The Rundown:</strong>\u00a0Former FBI international hostage negotiator Chris Voss joins us to share effective tactics and strategies you can use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal life and how to solve business communication challenges with these hostage-negotiation techniques.</p> <p><strong>Top Takeaway:</strong>\u00a0When negotiating, always use the \u201cmirror technique.\u201d Repeating the last three words someone said creates a connection and gives you permission to persuade.</p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote: \u201cYou become the smartest person in the room when you start tapping into other people\u2019s brains.\u201d</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcasts/bob-beaudine-relationships\"> Bob Beaudine\u2014The Power of Relationships</a></p> <p><strong>The Rundown:</strong>\u00a0Remember the days of going to local events, handing out cards, and hoping to grab some new business?

But often when everyone says, \u2018Hey that\u2019s a really bad idea,\u2019 they\u2019re right and you should listen to them.
