    "Description": "<p>In this episode, Emad Elwany, CTO & Co-founder @ Lexion, joins us to discuss navigating the messy\u00a0 \u201cin-between\u201d phase startups face as they scale up! We talk about the dilemma between optimizing for vertical or horizontal teams. And we cover his approach for aligning teams based on strategic themes / \u201ccomplete units of value\u201d on the company\u2019s product roadmap and navigating trade-offs when choosing your approach to scaling. Emad also shares strategies for successful interpersonal facilitation and how to build consensus effectively as an approach to sustain your org\u2019s internal velocity.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emadelwany/\"><strong>EMAD ELWANY</strong></a></h2><p>Emad Elwany is the CTO and co-founder of Lexion.

We're not going to do horizontal. Instead, let's be roadmap driven.' If you review our roadmap document, there's a section on key learnings from the past, and then there's a section on the three or four strategic areas we're investing in in the next quarter. So we thought, 'Okay, these strategic themes are very coherent. A lot of the projects on them are kind of homogenous but they span the full stack. They also span different functional areas. Why don't we try that? Why don't we have teams aligned to themes?'\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Emad Elwany \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Interested in joining an <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">ELC Peer Group?</a></h2><p>ELCs <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">Peer Groups</a> provide a virtual, curated, and ongoing peer learning opportunity to help you navigate the unknown, uncover solutions and accelerate your learning with a small group of trusted peers.</p><p><strong>Apply to join a peer group HERE:</strong> <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\"><strong>sfelc.com/peerGroups</strong></a></p><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Emad\u2019s observations around scaling up @ Lexion (2:50)</li><li>Strategies for dividing teams / products horizontally or vertically (5:17)</li><li>Navigating trade-offs when deciding the right approach for scaling up (7:39)</li><li>How to decide what areas to optimize vs. sacrifice (10:47)</li><li>Using your product roadmap to drive decision making / optimization (12:59)</li><li>Emad\u2019s process for forming new teams, identifying strategies & executing vision (15:48)</li><li>Fitting the trade-off discussion into this organization model (18:51)</li><li>Determining your org\u2019s specific \u201cbudget of problems\u201d (22:21)</li><li>Balancing the timing of problems vs. the quantity of problems (24:01)</li><li>Recommendations for interpersonal facilitation & building consensus (27:01)</li><li>How these actions can help improve & sustain your org\u2019s internal velocity (31:16)</li><li>Why velocity \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 impacts speedy, efficient decision-making (33:51)</li><li>Emad\u2019s favorite examples of his team finding consensus (35:37)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (38:17)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://press.stripe.com/scaling-people\">Scaling People: Tactics for Management and Company Building</a> -Claire Hughes Johnson\u2019s practical and empathetic guide to being an effective leader and manager in a high-growth environment.
