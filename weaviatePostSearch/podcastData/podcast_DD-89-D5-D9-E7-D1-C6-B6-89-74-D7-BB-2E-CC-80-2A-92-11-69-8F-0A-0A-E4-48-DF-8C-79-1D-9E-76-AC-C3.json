Prior to QA Wolf, Perl led engineering teams in the healthcare and home services space, where he learned firsthand how difficult automated regression testing can be \u2014 and how critical it is for teams to have. His interest in software engineering comes from an overarching desire to eliminate boring, repetitive tasks and give people their time back. He has a dog named Finn and enjoys hiking.</p><blockquote><p>\"Your goal is simply to book a meeting. You're not trying to close a deal through one email. It's like, 'How can I just get on the phone with somebody?' That's the goal.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Jon Perl \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markettohumans/\"><strong>SCOTT WILSON</strong></a></h2><p>As co-founder and head of growth at QA Wolf, Scott Wilson is trying to upend 20+ years of stagnation in the QA industry. Before this he launched the marketing efforts at Wyze and helped acquire 6 million paying customers. If he\u2019s not working, you might find him backpacking with Frank the dog, or learning a new illusion.</p><blockquote><p>\"It's not referencing the weather in Seattle or that you got promoted. Personalization is being contextually relevant to the person. This is how your mind should be thinking. It's like, 'I saw you're a hundred person company with nine engineers on your team and no QA engineers. You're probably going through this and here's a solution for it.'\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Scott Wilson \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>We\u2019re less than one week away from <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/glow/?utm_source=elc&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=glow-2024-promo&utm_content=text&utm_term=register\">GLOW 2024</a></h3><p>Attend GLOW 2024 - <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/\">Jellyfish\u2019s</a> virtual summit for engineering, product, and finance leaders who are looking to deliver greater business impact while building great software and teams.
