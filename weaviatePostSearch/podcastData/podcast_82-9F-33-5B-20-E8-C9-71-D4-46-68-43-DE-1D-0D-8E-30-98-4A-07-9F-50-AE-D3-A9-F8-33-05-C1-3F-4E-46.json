    "Description": "<p>Your SharePoint is on-premises (at least for now), but you want to take advantage of some of those cool SharePoint Online features - is there a way? Richard talks with Sandy Ussia about her talk at the Thrive Conference in Slovenia about how on-premises SharePoint can use Power Automate and other tools to create powerful workflows. Sandy discusses the limits of the free version of Power Automate and how paying for the premium edition lets you build workflows that will more than cover the license cost. The conversation also dives into the subscription model of on-premises SharePoint 2019, which looks to be the final destination for on-premises SharePoint, with ongoing support and features being added!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thriveconf.com/en/Pages/Home.aspx\">Thrive Conference</a></li><li><a href=\"https://lightningtools.com/\">Lightning Tools</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/upgrade-and-update/upgrade-to-sharepoint-server-subscription-edition\">Upgrade to SharePoint Server Subscription Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/sharepoint-overview\">Power Automate and SharePoint</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/introduction\">Power Automate Desktop</a></li><li><a href=\"https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/\">Power Automate Pricing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/gateway-reference\">SharePoint On-Premises Data Gateway</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 1, 2023</p>\n",
