    "Description": "\n        <p>When Fokke de Jong started selling suits out of his dorm room in Amsterdam in the late 90's, he wasn\u2019t planning on becoming the next Tom Ford\u2014he just wanted to supply luxury suits at an affordable price. But he was so successful that around 2000, Suitsupply went from his side hustle to his full-time gig. Fokke sourced the best fabrics and production in Italy, and grew the business by selling his wares online long before that was the norm. Suitsupply thrived on Fokke's unorthodox ideas, like when he opened his first physical shop by the side of a highway, or when he goaded competition into suing him over ads. By 2011, Suitsupply had grown beyond Holland, opening stores in cities like London, Milan, and New York. Today, they have over 150 locations worldwide.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
