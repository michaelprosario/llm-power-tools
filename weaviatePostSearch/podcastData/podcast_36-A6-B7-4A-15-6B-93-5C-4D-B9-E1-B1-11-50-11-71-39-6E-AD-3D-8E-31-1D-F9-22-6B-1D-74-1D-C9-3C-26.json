Pretty good for 1980.\u00a0</p><p>Weaveworks based their project on <a href=\"https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/\">Flux</a>, an open source engine. If you're not a big corporation and you want to use it, it's free!</p><p>Before there was Kubernetes, Google created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(cluster_manager)\">Borg</a>, an internal cluster manager. It has yet to be assimilated by Kubernetes.\u00a0</p><p>Ben thinks that, if it gets too easy to manage Kubernetes clusters, we'll be out of a job talking about the pain of cluster manages.\u00a0</p><p>Today's lifeboat badge goes to Daniel Ribeiro for the answer to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44263450/how-can-i-run-go-binary-files/44278127#44278127\">How can I run Go binary files?</a></p>\n",
