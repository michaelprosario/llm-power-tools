    "Description": "<p>What principles should you consider when designing a Python library? How do you construct a library API that&rsquo;s understandable and easy to use? This week on the show, Christopher Trudeau is here, bringing another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>We share an article about building library APIs. The piece provides advice for package structure, naming, error handling, and more. The author guides you toward Pythonic principles by comparing clunky vs elegant design examples.</p>\n<p>Christopher discusses his recent video course on Jinja templating. The course covers creating text files with programmatic content and employing rich templates to structure the front end of Python web applications. </p>\n<p>We cover several other articles and projects from the Python community, including several news updates, reasons why membership tests are fast for the <code>range()</code> function, CLI tools hidden in the Python standard library, a thread about the right way to install Python, recipes for using the Polars library, and a project for feature flags within Django.</p>\n<p>This week&rsquo;s episode is brought to you by Snyk.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/jinja-templating/\">Jinja Templating</a></p>\n<p>With Jinja, you can build rich templates that power the front end of your web applications. But you can use Jinja without a web framework running in the background. Anytime you want to create text files with programmatic content, Jinja can help you out.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:02:16 &ndash; PyLadies Conference (Dec 2023) Call for Volunteers</li>\n<li>00:02:32 &ndash; PSF Board Election Results</li>\n<li>00:03:47 &ndash; PSF Announces New Security Developer in Residence</li>\n<li>00:04:39 &ndash; Django Security Releases Issued</li>\n<li>00:04:50 &ndash; Deprecation of <code>bdist_egg</code> Uploads to PyPI</li>\n<li>00:05:54 &ndash; Why Are Membership Tests So Fast for <code>range()</code> in Python?</li>\n<li>00:11:51 &ndash; CLI Tools Hidden in the Python Standard Library</li>\n<li>00:15:59 &ndash; Sponsor: Snyk</li>\n<li>00:16:49 &ndash; Designing Pythonic Library APIs</li>\n<li>00:28:27 &ndash; Jinja Templating</li>\n<li>00:32:49 &ndash; Kill a Developer in 4 Words or Less</li>\n<li>00:37:28 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight </li>\n<li>00:38:51 &ndash; What is &ldquo;the right way&rdquo; to install Python on a new M2 MacBook?</li>\n<li>00:44:11 &ndash; polars-cookbook: Recipes for Using Python&rsquo;s Polars Library</li>\n<li>00:46:48 &ndash; waffle: Feature Flags for Django</li>\n<li>00:49:54 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>News:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pyladies.com/blog/Announcement-PyLadies-Conference/global-conference-announcement/\">PyLadies Conference (Dec 2023) Call for Volunteers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/06/announcing-2023-psf-board-election.html\">PSF Board Election Results</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/06/announcing-our-new-security-developer.html\">PSF Announces New Security Developer in Residence</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence\">I Am the First PSF Security Developer-in-Residence</a> &ndash; Seth was recently hired as the first security developer in residence at the PSF.
