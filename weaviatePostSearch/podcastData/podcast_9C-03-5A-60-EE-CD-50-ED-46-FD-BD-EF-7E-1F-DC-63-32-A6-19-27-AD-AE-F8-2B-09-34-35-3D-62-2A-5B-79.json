    "Description": "<p>I find Shannon Latimer to be such an interesting person, she is an educator, futurist, and creative powerhouse. In this compelling episode, we sit down with Shannon to explore the future of education and work in 2030. With a career journey that spans journalism, corporate communications, and teaching, Shannon shares how her diverse experiences have shaped her vision for integrating core academic courses with career-based learning opportunities. From enabling middle school students to embark on college courses to fostering real-world business collaborations for high schoolers, Shannon envisions an education system that equips students with the skills, confidence, and adaptability to thrive in an ever-evolving world. Her passion for connecting learning with real-world applications will leave listeners inspired to reimagine the classroom as a launchpad for lifelong success.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shannon also delves into the transformative potential of generative AI. While she champions the efficiency and productivity AI offers, she doesn\u2019t shy away from the ethical dilemmas these advancements pose, such as the importance of maintaining human connection and grappling with questions about robot autonomy.\u00a0 We discussed insights from AI pioneers like Geoffrey Hinton, she challenges listeners to think critically about the balance between innovation and ethics when using Gen AI. Shannon\u2019s mentoring advice is a call to action: stay flexible, embrace lifelong learning, and be ready for the unexpected. This episode is a must-listen for anyone curious about the intersection of education, technology, and the future of work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
