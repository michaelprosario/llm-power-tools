    "Description": "\n        <p>After working in the restaurant industry for nearly 30 years, Mina Group president Patric Yumul knows that outstanding service starts and ends with one thing: humility. But the first step, he says, toward that noble quality is realizing that your customers\u2014no matter what industry you\u2019re in\u2014have a choice. And your job is to serve them with such excellence that they choose you over and over (and over) again. Tune in as Patric explains how he and his team strive to achieve that every single day.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OJhlhs\">Bourbon Steak website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/34HCFZX\">Mina Group website</a></p> <p>Download:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2tkLWJJ\">5 Habits That Kill Team Unity</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Yat2Aw\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
