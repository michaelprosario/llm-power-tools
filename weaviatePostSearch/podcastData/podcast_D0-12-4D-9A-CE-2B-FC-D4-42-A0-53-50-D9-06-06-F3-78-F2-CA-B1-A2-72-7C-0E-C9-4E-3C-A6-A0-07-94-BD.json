    "Description": "<p>Scott talks with coder, tinkerer, and occasional adjunct professor Dawn C Hayes about the intersection of physical computing and creating coding. As we write code more, we have to ask ourselves &quot;but are we improving our world? The community? Our culture?&quot; The advent of wearables, augmented games, and networked objects has the potential to take computing out of the garage and into the collective consciousness. Dawn teaches Scott about how these objects can combine with new thinking around informal learning to engage not only new audiences but the next generation of creator.</p>\n",
