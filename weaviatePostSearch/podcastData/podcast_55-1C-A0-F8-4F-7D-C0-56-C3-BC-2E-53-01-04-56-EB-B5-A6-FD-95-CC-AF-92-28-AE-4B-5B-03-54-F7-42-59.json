    "SourceUrl": "https://www.hanselminutes.com/",
    "Description": "<p>Demis Bellot has put together an open source .NET and Mono REST Web Services framework called Service Stack. It's effectively a WCF replacement for some kinds of webservices. There's no XML and no code-generation. Why do frameworks like this exist and what kinds of things did Demis take into consideration when creating it? How does one balance performance vs. compliance?</p>\n",
