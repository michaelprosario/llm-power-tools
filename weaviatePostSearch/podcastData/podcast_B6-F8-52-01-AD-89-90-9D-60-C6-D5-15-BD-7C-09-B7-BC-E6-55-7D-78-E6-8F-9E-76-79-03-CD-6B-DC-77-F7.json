    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Andrew Brown, a CTO-turned co-founder of ExamPro.co.</p> <p>Andrew created this cloud certification exam prep website with another Andrew \u2013 also from Canada, who also loves Star Trek.</p> <p>We talk about Andrew's early career fixing computers in the 90s, and his early freelance web development work. These ultimately lead to jobs and promotions that leveled him up to CTO.</p> <p>Andrew also shares his advice to devs who want to learn DevOps and Cloud Engineering, and which certs to prioritize.</p> <p>Andrew suffers from Muscle Tension Dysphonia, a disease that causes voice loss. He shares how he's using AI tools to get around this.</p> <p>Andrew also talks about his love of Tetris Attack (also known as Panel de Pon or Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League). He built a frame-perfect port for competitive online play.</p> <p>And of course, Andrew's favorite Star Trek episodes of all time.</p> <p>Can you guess what bass line I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's the theme from a 90s cartoon.</p> <p>Be sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend.
