    "Description": "<p>In a New Stack Makers episode, Ashley Williams, founder and CEO of axo, highlights how the software world depends on open-source code, which is largely maintained by unpaid volunteers. She likens this to a CVS relying on volunteer-run shipping companies, pointing out how unsettling that might be for customers. The conversation focuses on open-source maintainers\u2019 reluctance to be seen as \"suppliers\" of software, an idea explored in a 2022 blog post by Thomas Depierre. Many maintainers reject the label, as there is no contractual obligation to support the software they provide.\u00a0</p><p>Williams critiques the industry's response to this, noting that instead of involving maintainers in software supply chain security, companies have relied on third-party vendors. However, these vendors have no relationship with the maintainers, leading to increased vulnerabilities. Williams advocates for better engagement with maintainers, especially at build time, to improve security. She also reflects on the growing pressures on maintainers and the underappreciation of release teams.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about open source software supply chain</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/2023-the-year-open-source-security-supply-chain-grew-up/\">2023: The Year Open Source Security Supply Chain Grew Up</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/fortifying-the-software-supply-chain/\">Fortifying the Software Supply Chain</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-challenges-of-securing-the-open-source-supply-chain/\">The Challenges of Securing the Open Source Supply Chain</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a></p>\n",
