    "Description": "<p>The pathway to a software developer job has shifted over the years. It used to be that you had to go through a college computer science program before you could get a developer job. But as online education became better and programming jobs became more specialized, people were getting hired on the strength of their bootcamp or certification experience. Our 2021 Developer Survey found that <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-experience-learning-how-to-code\">almost 60% of respondents learned to code using online resources</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Mike spent most of his time in the worlds of programmer education and publishing, including a 14 year stint at O\u2019Reilly Media. He worked with numerous great technologists, people who wrote popular languages, and other luminaries in the software world. Much of his focus was on analyzing the signals that come from the data he saw and the conversations with people around the world.\u00a0</p><p>What those signals told him was the focus for recruiters was on skills instead of educational background. A computer science education used to be the thing that proved you had the skills. But not everyone has the four years to spend getting a degree. In today\u2019s tech industry, many people turn to Skillsoft and other companies for certifications and classes that provide a quick boost in skills to prepare them for a changing job market.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not just people who want to break into programming who can benefit from online courses and certifications; working developers who want to continue to succeed need to make learning a habit. That can be hard to manage with a full-time job, so their organizations need to make learning a cultural norm. Setting time aside every day for learning pays dividends, not just for the individual, but for that organization.\u00a0</p><p>With the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/09/02/pandemic-lockdowns-accelerated-cloud-migration-by-three-to-four-years/\">incredible growth of cloud adoption</a> in the past couple of years, one of the hottest skills in demand right now is cloud engineering. Skillsoft offers an AWS certification course that prepares you for the certification exam.
