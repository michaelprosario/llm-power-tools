    "Description": "<p>Today high school math teacher, Chris Woods, gives us simple ideas of STEM activities any teacher can do. Get some ideas for how you can integrate STEM in the classroom.</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e560\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e560</a></p> Chris Woods - Bio as Submitted <p>Chris Woods has taught High School Math for over 20 years in rural Michigan. After sharing relevant STEM connections with his own students for years, Chris realized that not every teacher notices STEM everywhere. He decided to start sharing all of the ideas from his classroom, simple examples of STEM in the world around us everyday, ideas of how STEM is more than just robots and 3d printing and a buzzword used by politicians. Chris also started the STEM Educator Podcast to give educators a voice and share how they're incorporating STEM in simple ways into their classrooms. He continues to promote a STEM mindset while speaking at conferences, on his YouTube channel, at school science nights, and most importantly in his classroom.</p> <p>Blog: <a href= \"http://dailystem.com/\">http://dailystem.com/</a></p> <p>Twitter: @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/dailystem\">dailystem</a></p> <p>Podcast: The STEM Everyday Podcast <a class= \"text-blue underline\" href= \"https://remarkablechatter.com/category/podcasts/stem-everyday/\">https://remarkablechatter.com/category/podcasts/stem-everyday/</a></p>",
