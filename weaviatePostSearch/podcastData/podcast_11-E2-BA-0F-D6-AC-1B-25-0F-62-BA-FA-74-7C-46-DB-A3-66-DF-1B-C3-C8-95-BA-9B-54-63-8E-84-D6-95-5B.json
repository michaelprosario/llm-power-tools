    "Description": "<p>Developers are often faced with complexity when building and operating long-running processes that involve multiple service calls and require continuous coordination. To solve this challenge, Uber built and introduced Cadence, the open-source solution for workflow orchestration in 2016 that enables developers to directly express complex, long-running business logic as simple code. Since its debut, it continues to find increased traction with developers operating large-scale, microservices-based architectures. More recently, Instaclustr announced support for a hosted version of Cadence.</p></p><p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-slater-2720562/?originalSubdomain=au\">Ben Slater,</a> Chief Product Officer at Instaclustr and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emrahseker/\">Emrah Seker,</a> Staff Software Engineer at Uber discuss Cadence, and how it is used by developers to solve various business problems by enabling them to focus on writing code for business logic, without worrying about the complexity of distributed systems.</p></p><p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a>, founder and publisher of The New Stack hosted this podcast, along with co-host <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/joab/\">Joab Jackson</a>, Editor-in-Chief of The New Stack.</p>\n",
