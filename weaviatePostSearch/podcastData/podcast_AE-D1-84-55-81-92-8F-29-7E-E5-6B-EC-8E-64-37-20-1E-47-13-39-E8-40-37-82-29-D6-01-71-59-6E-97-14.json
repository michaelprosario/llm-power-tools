I use a free program called <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/planboard?utm_source=coolcatteacher\">Planboard</a> for my lesson planning. My school uses Planboard with <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/\">Chalk.com</a>\u2019s curriculum planning tool. This powerful tool links with standards -- and gives us the ability to do some timesaving, efficient reporting and tracking. The best thing about Planboard is I can plan my lessons anywhere - on my Mac, PC or iPad. Wherever I work, my lesson plans are with me. And as I said, Planboard is FREE for teachers. I hope you\u2019ll check out Planboard now!</p> Dr. Matthew Rhoads - Bio as Submitted <p>Matthew Rhoads, Ed.D. is an Educational Specialist at a secondary school in a school district located in North San Diego County.
