    "Description": "<p>High school junior Jameson Cohen was looking forward to Spring Baseball Season. When he found out he\u2019d be spending it at home, he turned it into a season of giving back. Not only was he able to feed and connect with people in need, he created a special organization called \u201cCircle of Friends\u201d -- designed to encourage children of HealthCare workers right from his own home. This is one example of how students are giving back for National Volunteer Week April 20-25.

He is passionate about taking action in his community and wants to ensure he is doing everything he can to continue to spread light and positivity in the world. In light of what is happening in the world and the high demand and pressure on medical professionals, Jameson is focusing his efforts supporting health care professionals who bravely work everyday to ensure the rest of us are safe and feel protected in our homes. He has been supporting a local restaurant package and deliver meals to hospitals around New York City.  As part of National Volunteer Week (April 20 - 25), Jameson is giving back thorough the WE Volunteer Now campaign (<a class= \"text-blue underline\" contenteditable=\"plaintext-only\" href= \"https://www.we.org/en-CA/our-work/we-schools/we-schools-campaigns-and-curriculum/service-learning-campaigns/take-action/we-volunteer-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.we.org/en-CA/our-work/we-schools/we-schools-campaigns-and-curriculum/service-learning-campaigns/take-action/we-volunteer-now</a>) -- encouraging his peers to take action and volunteer in their communities . Jameson has started \u201cCircle of Friends\u201d, a volunteer program that provides virtual programming to medical professionals, educators and parents who need help keeping their children engaged and excited during this uneasy time. Circle of Friends pairs a family with a volunteer over the age of 16 and arranges a 30 minute session focusing on an array of activities. From helping with homework, partaking in a \u201cprivate yoga lesson\u201d or even having a fun conversation about sports. Jameson hopes this platform is a way to support parents whilst also instilling a sense of hope within young people to continue to pursue their passions and interests during this time.</p>",
