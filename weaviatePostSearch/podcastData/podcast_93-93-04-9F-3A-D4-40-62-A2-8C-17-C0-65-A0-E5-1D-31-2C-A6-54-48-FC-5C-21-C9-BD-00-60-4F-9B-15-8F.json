    "Description": "She got into tech by doing temporary data entry at the then little-known startup, Yammer. But she saw the opportunities available to those who could code, so she taught herself, taking on more responsibilities to finally become a designer and developer. Julie Ann Horvath opens up about her humble beginnings, what she learned from her controversial exit at Github last year, and the role she plays as an advocate for a more inclusive tech industry.
