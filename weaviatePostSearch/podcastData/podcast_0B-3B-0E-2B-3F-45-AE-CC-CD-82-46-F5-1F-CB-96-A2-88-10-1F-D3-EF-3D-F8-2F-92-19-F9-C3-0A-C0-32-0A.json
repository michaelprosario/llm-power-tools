    "Description": "<p>You can check out the back story of Dixon\u2019s first company, SiteAdvisor, <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2562060/mcafee-buys-siteadvisor.html\">here</a>. It was built during a time when spyware was a booming business and browsers had few systems in place to combat bad actors. The company was acquired by McAfee in 2006. It's a great trip through the history of web security at the time.<br />\u00a0</p><p>Dixon next turned his attention to machine learning. He and his co-founders created Hunch, which worked to learn users\u2019 tastes and recommend items they might enjoy. It was an early attempt to build the taste graph, a parallel to the social graph. It was <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-acquires-recommendation-engine-hunchcom/\">acquired by eBay in 2011</a>. Many of these techniques are now widely used across the biggest social networks in the world.</p><p><br />Dixon then moved into the world of venture capital. You can read more about the Crypto Fund he helps to <a href=\"https://medium.com/bitrates-news/chris-dixon-announces-launch-of-300-million-a16z-crypto-fund-fe6ffa43c3a6\">lead</a> and the new <a href=\"https://events.a16z.com/cryptostartupschool/\">startup school</a> a16Zz is launching to help educate a new generation of programmers and founders. Application are still open.</p><p>If you're interested in learning more about the background of Hashcash, which foreshadowed a lot of the ideas found in Bitcoin, there is some good info <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash\">here</a>.</p>\n",
