    "Description": "<p>How can Viva Learning improve your team's productivity? Richard chats with Ulrika Hedlund about how the latest generation of tools from Microsoft helps measure productivity and focus on learning opportunities. The M365 platform can show where employees struggle with tools that lead to learning opportunities - and then measure the results! Ulrika talks about the various kinds of learning needed within an organization, including compulsory learnings for regulated industries, standard corporate training, and then moving more into productivity and industry-focused knowledge. Viva Learning and the related tools make it easier than ever to build custom learning materials that can make learning more specific to your company and fun as well!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/productivity-score/\">Microsoft Productivity Score</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/\">LinkedIn Learning</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/learning\">Viva Learning</a></li><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/announcing-employee-learning-api-for-viva-learning/ba-p/3568719\">Learning API for Viva Learning</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 9, 2022</p>\n",
