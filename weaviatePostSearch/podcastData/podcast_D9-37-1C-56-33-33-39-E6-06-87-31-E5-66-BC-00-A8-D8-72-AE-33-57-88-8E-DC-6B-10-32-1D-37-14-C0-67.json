    "Description": "<p>Any large organization with multiple products faces the challenge of keeping their brand identity unified without denying each product its own charisma. That\u2019s where a design system can help developers avoid reinventing the wheel every time, say,\u00a0 a new button gets created\u00a0</p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we talk with Demian Borba, Principal Product Manager, and Kelvin Nguyen, Senior Engineering Manager, both of Intuit. We chat about how their design system is evolving into a platform, how AI keeps their brand consistent, and why a design system doesn\u2019t have to solve every use case.\u00a0</p><h2>Episode notes</h2><p>Treating a design system as a platform means providing a baseline of tokens\u2014colors, typography, themes\u2014and allowing developers to deviate so long as they use the right tokens.\u00a0</p><p>Alongside a company-wide push towards greater AI usage, Intuit\u2019s design system team is beginning to leverage AI to help developers make better design decisions. As an example, they\u2019re including typeahead functionality to suggest possible solutions to design decisions.\u00a0</p><p>The team is using a Figma plugin to manage a lot of the heavy lifting. <a href=\"https://config.figma.com/events/figma-config-2022/talks/3019f39a15a1?type=item\">Their presentation at Config 2022</a> built a lot of excitement for what\u2019s possible.\u00a0</p><p>Congrats to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2526842/redvelvet\">RedVelvet</a>, who won a great question badge for <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33626623/the-most-efficient-way-to-remove-first-n-elements-in-a-list\">The most efficient way to remove first N elements in a list?</a></p><p>Find <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelyvin/\">Kelvin</a>\u00a0 and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/demianborba/\">Demian</a>\u00a0 on Linkedin.</p>\n",
