    "Description": "<p>Substack was founded to create an escape vehicle for writers: Chris Best and Hamish McKenzie imagined a world where writers didn\u2019t have to rely on legacy publications or corporate advertisers, but could instead create a more direct and meaningful relationship with their audience. Despite early skepticism, Chris and Hamish were confident that many people would pay a few dollars a month to subscribe to their favorite newsletters, on subjects ranging from politics to sports to tech. Today, Substack has over 35 million active users, and while many of its offerings are free, a number of its content-creators make upwards of $500,000 a year.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
