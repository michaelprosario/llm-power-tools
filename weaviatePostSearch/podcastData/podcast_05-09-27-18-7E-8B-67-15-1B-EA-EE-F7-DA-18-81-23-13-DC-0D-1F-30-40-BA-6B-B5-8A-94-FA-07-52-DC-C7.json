    "Description": "<p>CodeRabbit, led by founder Harjot Gill, is tackling one of software development's biggest bottlenecks: the human code review process. While AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot have sped up code generation, they\u2019ve inadvertently slowed down shipping due to increased complexity in code reviews. Developers now often review AI-generated code they didn\u2019t write, leading to misunderstandings, bugs, and security risks. In an episode of <i>The New Stack Makers</i>, Gill discusses how Code Rabbit leverages advanced reasoning models\u2014OpenAI\u2019s o1, o3 mini, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude series\u2014to automate and enhance code reviews.\u00a0</p><p>Unlike rigid, rule-based static analysis tools, Code Rabbit builds rich context at scale by spinning up sandbox environments for pull requests and allowing AI agents to navigate codebases like human reviewers. These agents can run CLI commands, analyze syntax trees, and pull in external context from Jira or vulnerability databases. Gill envisions a hybrid future where AI handles the grunt work of code review, empowering humans to focus on architecture and intent\u2014ultimately reducing bugs, delays, and development costs.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights about AI code reviews:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/coderabbits-ai-code-reviews-now-live-free-in-vs-code-cursor/\">CodeRabbit's AI Code Reviews Now Live Free in VS Code, Cursor\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/ai-coding-agents-level-up-from-helpers-to-team-players/\">AI Coding Agents Level Up from Helpers to Team Players\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/augment-code-an-ai-coding-tool-for-real-development-work/\">Augment Code: An AI Coding Tool for 'Real' Development Work</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
