    "Description": "<p>Long before founding Torchy\u2019s Tacos, Mike Rypka was a troubled teenager trying to outrun his own self-destruction. Growing up around addiction and falling into heavy drug use himself, Mike\u2019s future looked bleak\u2014until he got clean and found refuge in kitchens. Cooking gave him structure, purpose, and eventually, a career.</p><p><br></p><p>After years working in restaurants and corporate kitchens, Mike decided to take a risk on something smaller: a food truck on a street corner in Austin. In 2006, he launched Torchy\u2019s with nothing but a dream, a fiery logo, and a menu full of bold flavors. That humble truck became the start of something much bigger. Today, Torchy\u2019s is a national chain with more than 130 locations and annual sales topping $300 million. And through all of it, Mike has remained sober\u2014more than three decades and counting.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves and edited by Kevin Leahy, with research by Katherine Sypher and music by Ramtin Arablouei.
