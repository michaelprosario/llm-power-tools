    "Description": "<p>The hardest business problem has a soft solution. Scientists and engineers display a (well-deserved) skepticism toward touchy-feely ideas such as leadership. Fred shows there's a very technical way to understand why most organizations, from couples to multinational corporations, die a premature death... and what can be done to extend their lifespan.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>FRED KOFMAN - Advisor, VP of Leadership Development @ Google (</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fredkofman\"><strong>@fredkofman</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p><i>\u201cNo gun in the world can get your best. No incentive can get your best. You can only give your best because you want to. It\u2019s not contractible. And that\u2019s the difference between leadership and management for me. Leadership is about eliciting internal commitment. You do it because it comes from the inside.\u201d - Fred Kofman</i></p><p>Fred Kofman earned his PhD. in Economics from the UC Berkeley, is Google\u2019s Vice President and advisor of leadership, a director of the Conscious Leadership Center at the Monterrey Institute of Technology, & a founder and president of the Conscious Business Center International. Previously, he was a VP of Executive Development at LinkedIn & a co-founder of Axialent, a global consulting company that has delivered leadership programs to more than 15,000 executives around the world.</p><p>Fred is the author of the trilogy Metamanagement ('01), Conscious Business ('06) and The Meaning Revolution: The Power of Transcendent Leadership ('18). Since 1990, Fred has designed and facilitated programs on leadership, personal mastery, team learning, organizational effectiveness and coaching for thousands of executives, and consultants worldwide. His book, Conscious Business, has been translated to more than ten languages, received numerous awards and was recently named by Sheryl Sandberg in her New York Times interview as \"the business book every executive should read\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3><strong>RESOURCES</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://fredkofman.org/la-revolucion-del-sentido-ing.html\">Meaning Revolution</a></li><li><a href=\"https://fredkofman.org/la-empresa-consciente-ing.html\">Conscious Business</a><br />\u00a0</li></ul><p><strong>SHOW NOTES</strong></p><ul><li>You don\u2019t know your job.
