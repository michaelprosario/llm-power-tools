    "Description": "Eberhard and Markus discuss the important topic of associations and dependencies in this show. While OO languages provide direct support for subtyping, most don't provide a first-class construct for other relationships between objects. The discussion elaborates on the problem and looks at various remedies, most importantly, dependency injection.",
