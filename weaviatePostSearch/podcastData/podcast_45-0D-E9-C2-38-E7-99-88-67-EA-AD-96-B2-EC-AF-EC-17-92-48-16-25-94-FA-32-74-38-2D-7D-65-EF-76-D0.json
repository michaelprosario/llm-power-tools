    "Description": "<p>Patti Brownsord is today\u2019s Intern Whisperer guest. What do you think of when you hear the career path - Data Analytics. Something that sounds uninspiring or dry? Patti is nothing like that at all. She is funny, quirky, and smart (Three of her five words by the way). I met Patti at a networking event and overheard her mention that she is the Chair of the UCF Data Analytics Advisory Board. I asked her \u201cWhere can I sign up to join?\u201d Data analytics are some of the top trending career paths of the future and I was so happy to see a woman in this field. What was even better, is that Patti is really funny. Tune into the show to learn how she got started in data analytics before it was a thing. I also loved the quote she shared that gives her inspiration. \u201cI am still learning.\u201d On the show, we thought this was passed on by Michaelangelo. Turns out it was originally penned by Seneca's 76th Letter to Lucilius published in 65 AD. Shout out and thank you to our source: ME Carsley. We know that learning is both difficult and wonderful. And the discomfort that comes from learning is less welcome as we age. Yet life's experiences teach us that to stop learning is to stop creating. It is fitting too that this quote is associated with Michelangelo.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
