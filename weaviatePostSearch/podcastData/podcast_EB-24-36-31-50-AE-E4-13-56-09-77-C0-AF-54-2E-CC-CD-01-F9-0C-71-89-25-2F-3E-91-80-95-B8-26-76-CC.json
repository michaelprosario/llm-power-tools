    "Description": "<p>Huge thanks to the more than 73,000 devs from 180 countries who spent 15 minutes each completing our <a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/\">2022 Developer Survey</a>. This year\u2019s survey was longer than usual, since we wanted to ask about new topics as well as provide a historical throughline to understand how your responses have changed <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey\">over the years</a>.</p><p>Among the takeaways from the survey: 2022 saw a 10% jump in how many folks are learning to code online (versus through a conventional coding school or from textbooks). Nearly 85% of organizations represented in the survey have at least some remote workers, while the vast majority of developers are still working remotely at least part of the time. You can read more about the results <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/\">here</a>.</p><p>Worth noting: Just because you\u2019ve learned to code doesn\u2019t mean you have to pursue a career as a programmer. Here are <a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/4-careers-for-people-with-coding-backgrounds\">four different career paths</a> coders can follow, including product manager and sales engineer.</p><p>Wondering how Ikea\u2019s Friheten or Fj\u04d3dermoln would actually look in your living room?
