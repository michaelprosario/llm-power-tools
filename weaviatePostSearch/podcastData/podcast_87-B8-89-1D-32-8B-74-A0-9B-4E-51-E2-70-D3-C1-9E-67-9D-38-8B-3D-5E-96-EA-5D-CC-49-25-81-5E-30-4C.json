    "Description": "<p>At the close of this year\u2019s Google Cloud Next, The New Stack\u2019s Alex Williams, AI editor Frederic Lardinois, and analyst Janakiram MSV discussed the event\u2019s dominant theme: AI agents. The conversation focused heavily on agent frameworks, noting a shift from last year's third-party tools like Langchain, CrewAI, and Microsoft\u2019s Autogen, to first-party offerings from model providers themselves. Google\u2019s newly announced Agent Development Kit (ADK) highlights this trend, following closely on the heels of OpenAI\u2019s agent SDK. MSV emphasized the significance of this shift, calling it a major milestone as Google joins the race alongside Microsoft and OpenAI.\u00a0</p><p>Despite the buzz, Lardinois pointed out that many companies are still exploring how AI agents can fit into real-world workflows. The panel also highlighted how Google now delivers a full-stack AI development experience \u2014 from models to deployment platforms like Vertex AI. New enterprise tools like Agent Space and Agent Garden further signal Google\u2019s commitment to making agents a core part of modern software development.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest in AI agents:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-agents-will-change-the-web-for-users-and-developers/ \">How AI Agents Will Change the Web for Users and Developers\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/ \">AI Agents: A Comprehensive Introduction for Developers\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-are-coming-for-your-saas-stack/ \">AI Agents Are Coming for Your SaaS Stack\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
