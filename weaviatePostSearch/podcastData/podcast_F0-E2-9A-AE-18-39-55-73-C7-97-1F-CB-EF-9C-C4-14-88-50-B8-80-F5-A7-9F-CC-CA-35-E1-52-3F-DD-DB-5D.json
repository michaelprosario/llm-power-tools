    "Description": "<p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, Uma Daniel, a product manager at UST, discusses the current complexities in the global economy, marked by low unemployment except in the tech industry, high inflation, high interest rates, a volatile stock market, and the looming threat of recession. Amid these challenges, organizations are seeking ways to enhance their operational efficiency.</p><p>Daniel introduces the concept of FinOps, which goes beyond just managing cloud costs. Instead, it focuses on leveraging the cloud to generate revenue. This represents a cultural shift in many organizations, emphasizing the need for a mindset change across different departments, including business, finance, and procurement.</p><p>She dispels misconceptions, such as the belief that only certain teams should be involved in the FinOps process. Daniel stresses that it's a collaborative effort involving various teams, and it's best to adopt FinOps at the beginning of a cloud journey. Once an organization is already established in the cloud, implementing FinOps becomes more challenging.</p><p>To foster collaboration, Daniel suggests identifying team members willing to champion FinOps and forming cross-functional teams to lead the initiative. Regular committee meetings and the establishment of generic policies, such as project budgets, help control cloud spending.</p><p>This episode, hosted by Heather Joslyn, provides insights into how to initiate and implement a FinOps strategy and highlights common ways in which organizations waste cloud resources.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about FinOps and UST:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloud-cost-unit-economics-a-modern-profitability-model/\">Cloud Cost-Unit Economics \u2014 A Modern Profitability Model</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/what-is-finops-understanding-finops-best-practices-for-cloud/\">What Is FinOps?
