    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Gary Simon, a developer and designer who started DesignCourse.com and has published several courses on freeCodeCamp.org over the years.</p> <p>We talk about: - Growing up in rural Ohio, marrying young, and staying out there despite his success as a developer and entrepreneur. - Early client work, and how he designed thousands of logos for clients before becoming an all-out web developer. - Using his skills to help his wife start her own lactation consultant business online - Gary's guitar shredding chops.</p> <p>I recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails.</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1995s Nintendo game.</p> <p> Be sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend.
