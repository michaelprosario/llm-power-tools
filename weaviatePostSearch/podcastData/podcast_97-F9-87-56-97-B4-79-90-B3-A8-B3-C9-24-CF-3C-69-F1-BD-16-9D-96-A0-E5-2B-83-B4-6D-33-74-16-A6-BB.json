    "Description": "\n        <p>Serial entrepreneur and Atlanta Hawks owner <a href=\"http://www.the100mileman.com/\">Jesse Itzler</a> joins us to share his story of getting out of a rut and why every business owner needs to do the same. Warning, though: Itzler took it to the extreme. The former rapper and co-founder of Marquis Jet invited a Navy SEAL to live with him and his wife for a month so he could train with the toughest man on the planet. So if you feel like you need to break the routine and continue growing, listen in. This one is definitely for you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\">entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/highperformance\">Dave's High-Performance mp3 Download</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://interactive.infusionsoft.com/crm-adoption-checklist?ls=strat-bizdev_general-strat_isebook~dave-ramsey-field-guide-adoption-ebook~2016-01-04__&amp;utm_source=general-strat&amp;utm_medium=strat-bizdev&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=isebook~dave-ramsey-field-guide-adoption-ebook~2016-01-04\">Infusionsoft's Field Guide to CRM</a></p>\n      ",
