    "Description": "<p>Richard and Greg talk to Dana Epp about DirectAccess. DirectAccess is Microsoft's new technology using Windows 7 (Enterprise or Ultimate) and Server 2008 R2 together to create remote connectivity that acts in all respects like you're still inside the corporate network. DirectAccess has the potential to put client-initiated VPN connection out to pasture. The conversation also dives into IPv6, which is required for DirectAccess, digging into how IPv6 has probably been functioning fine over your IPv4 network and you didn't even realize it!</p>\n",
