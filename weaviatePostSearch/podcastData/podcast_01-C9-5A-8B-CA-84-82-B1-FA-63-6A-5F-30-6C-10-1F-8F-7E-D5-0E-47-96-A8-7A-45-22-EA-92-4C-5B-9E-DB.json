The team had developed a strong internal support system, understood their code of conduct, and took ownership of their decisions. For Dominika, the ultimate sign of success is when the team operates independently, learning and growing together.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  Is your team ready to operate independently, or do they still rely on you for guidance?

This format opens up discussions on different perspectives within the team and creates a safe space for sharing. It also helps teams focus on what they can impact, driving actionable improvements.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Dominika Bula Dominika is an Agile Coach at SAP Signavio with a strong background in agile practices from her experiences at Oracle and Red Hat.
