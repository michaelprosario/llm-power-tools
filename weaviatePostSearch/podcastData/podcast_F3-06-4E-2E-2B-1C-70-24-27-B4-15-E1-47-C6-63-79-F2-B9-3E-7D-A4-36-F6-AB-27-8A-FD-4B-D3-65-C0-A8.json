While managers often push for hard metrics, Richard argues that soft indicators\u2014like team self-organization and PO engagement\u2014are much more revealing.</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: The Sailboat Retrospective <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Richard discusses his favorite retrospective format, the Sailboat retrospective. He explains how it uses metaphors to engage teams and bring future risks and opportunities into the conversation. While Richard values simplicity in retrospectives, he believes the Sailboat format strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and meaningful engagement.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  [IMAGE HERE]  Retrospectives, planning sessions, vision workshops, we are continuously helping teams learn about how to collaborate in practice!
