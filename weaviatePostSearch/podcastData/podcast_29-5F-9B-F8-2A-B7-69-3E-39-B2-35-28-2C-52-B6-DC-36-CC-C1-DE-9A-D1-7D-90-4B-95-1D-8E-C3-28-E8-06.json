    "Description": "<p>Do you realize just how important you are as a teacher? Sometimes people say, <em>\u201cThank you for all you do\u201d</em> but do they really understand just what I do? I heard this story several years a go from someone dear to me that completely transformed my life and understanding about how remarkable we teachers truly are.</p> <p>My name is Vicki Davis. I am best known for blogging at the <em>Cool Cat Teacher Blog</em> and for my sharing on Twitter where I have 136,741 Twitter as of the day I released this show. I previously hosted the show Every Classroom Matters. In this first episode of the 10 Minute Teacher Show, I\u2019m sharing a story that gets to the heart of who we teachers are. I\u2019ll also share my vision for this show and what you can expect to find every day.</p> <p>This story is a precious one to me.</p> <p>Show notes and transcript: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/sue-and-mrs-scruggs/\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/sue-and-mrs-scruggs/</a>\u00a0</p>",
