    "Description": "<p>Tia Caldwell, former Director of Engineering @ Slack, shares different frameworks she\u2019s used to motivate teams and unlock their superpowers! We cover methods to identify, maximize, & balance strengths on your team, how to shift your team\u2019s mindset from <i>drama</i> to EMPOWERED so they can better confront adversity & challenges. Plus we share the explicit conversations you should be having in your first 1:1s to create greater psychological safety!</p><p><i>\u201cYou don't need to have this manager game face. I think there's this perception that when you're a manager, you're supposed to be the person who knows the answers to everything\u2026 And while a part of the execution piece is really necessary with being an effective manager, I think the other part is relationship building. You need to invest the time in understanding how people work. Because people will be more open and honest with you, it'll help out with retention for your team and overall happiness. But if you don't\u2026 it's not going to go well because you'll be treating people as resources and not humans.\u201d</i></p><p><strong>TIA CALDWELL, FORMER DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING @ SLACK</strong></p><p>Tia led the Monetization Team at Slack, a leading global collaboration hub that makes people\u2019s working lives simpler, more pleasant and more productive.
