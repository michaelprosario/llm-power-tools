    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp Founder Quincy Larson interviews Leon Noel, founder of 100Devs and head of engineering at Resilient Coders.  Growing up, Leon had it drilled into him that he had to become a doctor, lawyer, or dentist. But his ambitions grew and he went on to have an exciting career in tech.  After a successful exit from a startup, Leon wanted to help folks who were struggling during the pandemic. He started 100Devs, a charity which has helped 10,000s of people learn to code.  We talk about:</p> <ul> <li>dropping out of Yale</li> <li>getting into the selective Tech Stars startup accelerator</li> <li>Getting involved with Resilient Coders, a charity that helps court-involved youth learn coding</li> <li>Starting 100Devs and building a Discord server with 60,000 people learning to code together</li> </ul> <p> Quincy recorded this podcast live and hasn't edited it at all. We want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails.  Can you guess what song he's playing on my bass during the intro? It's his arrangement of the intro to a 1990s cartoon.  Be sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend.
