    "Description": "<p>Jetstack\u2019s cert-manager, a leading open-source project in Kubernetes certificate management, began as a job interview challenge. Co-founder Matt Barker recalls asking a prospective engineer to automate Let\u2019s Encrypt within Kubernetes. By Monday, the candidate had created kube-lego, which evolved into cert-manager, now downloaded over 500 million times monthly.</p><p>Cert-manager\u2019s journey to CNCF graduation, achieved in September, began with its donation to the foundation four years ago. Relaunched as cert-manager, the project grew under engineer James Munnelly, becoming the de facto standard for certificate lifecycle management. The thriving community and ecosystem around cert-manager highlighted its suitability for CNCF stewardship. However, maintainers, including Ashley Davis, noted challenges in navigating differing opinions within its vast user base.</p><p>With graduation achieved, cert-manager\u2019s roadmap includes sub-projects like trust-manager, addressing TLS trust bundle management and Istio integration. Barker aims to streamline enterprise-scale deployments and educate security teams on cert-manager\u2019s impact. Cert-manager has become integral to cloud-native workflows, promising to simplify hybrid, multicloud, and edge deployments.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about cert-manager:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/jetstacks-certificate-management-project-joins-the-cncf-sandbox-of-cloud-native-technologies/\">Jetstack\u2019s cert-manager Joins the CNCF Sandbox of Cloud Native Technologies</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/jetstack-secure-promises-to-ease-kubernetes-tls-security/\">Jetstack Secure Promises to Ease Kubernetes TLS Security</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
