    "Description": "<p>About three years ago, when our public platform engineering team at Stack started growing, we realized that we needed a more robust formal project management system that could scale with all the creativity coming on board. That\u2019s when we started looking at formal, by-the-book frameworks to empower and coach our teams to their fullest potential. We landed on Agile and Scrum.\u00a0</p><p>Admittedly, our development team was nervous about implementing <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/\">Scrum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/\">Agile</a> at first. So we focused on the goals of introspection and accountability rather than the rigidness of enforcement.</p><p>Agile and Scrum get a lot of hate. But <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/29/does-scrum-ruin-great-engineers-or-are-you-doing-it-wrong/\">is that their fault or are you doing it wrong</a>?</p><p>We talked about this on the podcast a few years ago, when Ben, Paul, and Sara wondered, \u201c<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/17/podcast-253-is-scrum-making-you-a-worse-engineer/\">Is Scrum making you a worse engineer?</a>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s about providing support\u2014not punishing people. Done right, Agile and Scrum can be a force of freedom and autonomy <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/28/agility-starts-with-trust/\">when they start with trust</a>.</p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanda-woods/\">Shanda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonhmchan/\">Jon</a> on LinkedIn.</p><p>We conclude with a big high five to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/8842/lifeboat\">Lifeboat badge</a> winner<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/85788/jminkler\"> jminkler </a>for their answer to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57392424/how-can-i-create-an-instagram-sharer-link-in-php/57395059#57395059\">how to create an Instagram share link in PHP</a> (thank you).</p><p>\u2018Til next time.</p>\n",
