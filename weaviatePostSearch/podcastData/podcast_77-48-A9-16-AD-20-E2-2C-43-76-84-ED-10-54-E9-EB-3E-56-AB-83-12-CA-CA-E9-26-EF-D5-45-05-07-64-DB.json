    "Description": "<p>How has Azure been innovating lately? While at Build Richard chatted with Azure CTO Mark Russinovich about some of the latest innovations in Azure, including some of the new hardware available. Mark talks about working with hardware manufacturers to build servers optimized to the workloads the largest Azure customers need. The conversation also explores the new innovations in AI and how Azure is being optimized to serve those workloads - and be shaped by them! Mark also talks about how material science is evolving with generative AI technologies leading to a discussion about the coming role of quantum computing - and how that will live in the cloud as well!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSf4XZvYgZPUXgSrfzBN26pf\">Scott and Mark Learn to...</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/compute-optimized/f-family?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Azure F-Family VMs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-hollow-core-fiber-is-accelerating-ai/\">Hollow Core Fiber</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/02/19/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-the-worlds-first-quantum-processor-powered-by-topological-qubits/\">Majorana 1 Quantum Processor</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 20, 2025</p>\n",
