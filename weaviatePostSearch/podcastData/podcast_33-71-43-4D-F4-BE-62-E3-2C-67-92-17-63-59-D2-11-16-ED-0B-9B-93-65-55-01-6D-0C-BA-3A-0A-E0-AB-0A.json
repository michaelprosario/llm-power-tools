    "Description": "<p>Teaching kindergarten has never been easy, but could you imagine doing it for forty-four years? Mrs. Sharon Howard has done just that. She reflects on her teaching career, the kind of teaching she does that would cause a senior to name her as a STAR teacher, and how she taught in-person in 2020-2021 without missing a day of school. Mrs. Howard is a truly remarkable woman and I hope you enjoy getting to know her as much as I have. Congratulations on your retirement, Mrs. Howard and for all of the contributions you made to so many children and families over the years! This is a bonus, extended episode of the 10 Minute Teacher.</p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e748\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e748</a></p> <p>Read: <a href= \"https://www.albanyherald.com/news/beloved-sherwood-kindergarten-teacher-announces-retirement/article_6cc02fd2-c7bc-11eb-935b-27adf0945a3b.html#:~:text=ALBANY%20%E2%80%93%20After%20teaching%20kindergarten%20at,Academy%20was%20established%20in%201985.\"> Beloved Sherwood Kindergarten teacher retires</a> at the Albany Herald to learn more about Mrs. Sharon Howard and her career.</p>",
