    "Description": "<p>Robert Seacord, the Standardization Lead at Woven by Toyota, the convenor of the C standards committee, and author of <em>The CERT\u00ae C</em> <em>Coding Standard</em>, <em>Effective C</em>, and <em>Secure Coding in C and C++</em>, speaks with SE Radio host <a class=\"css-1rn59kg\" title= \"/team/gavin-henry/\" href=\"https://se-radio.net/team/gavin-henry/\" data-testid=\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark=\"true\">Gavin Henry</a> about What's New in the C Programming Language.</p> <p>They start with a review of the history of C and why it has a standard, and then they discuss what C23 brings and how programmers can take advantage of it. They consider the sectors in which C is most used and whether you should use C to start a brand new project in 2025. Seacord discusses 8 new things that C23 brings, use case examples, must haves, floating point numbers, how automotive systems use C, why C is used there, Rust vs C, compile time checks vs static analysis, all the various safety standards they can use, why you should use the right tool for the job and never trust user input no matter the language.\u00a0</p> <p>Brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.computer.org&source=gmail&ust=1736383121348000&usg=AOvVaw2D6SdpUJ6nsmutZ6JHswME\"> IEEE Computer Society</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.computer.org/software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.computer.org/software&source=gmail&ust=1736383121348000&usg=AOvVaw135oEo1g1XgX9KAQ6LyWQu\">IEEE Software magazine.</a></p>",
