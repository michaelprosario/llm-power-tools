    "Description": "When we talk about open source, we focus mostly on the code and contributions. But as a crucial element of the developer ecosystem, it\u2019s important to think about the business side of things. How does it sustain itself? Is there money in open source? If there is, who gets it? Developer and open source maintainer Safia Abdalla helps us tackle these questions to better understand how open source really works.
