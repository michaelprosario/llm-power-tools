    "Description": "<p>This week Dr. Tim Scarfe, Dr. Keith Duggar and Connor Leahy chat with Prof. Karl Friston. Professor Friston is a British neuroscientist at University College London and an authority on brain imaging. In 2016 he was ranked the most influential neuroscientist on Semantic Scholar. &nbsp;His main contribution to theoretical neurobiology is the variational Free energy principle, also known as active inference in the Bayesian brain. The FEP is a formal statement that the existential imperative for any system which survives in the changing world can be cast as an inference problem. Bayesian Brain Hypothesis states that the brain is confronted with ambiguous sensory evidence, which it interprets by making inferences about the hidden states which caused the sensory data. So is the brain an inference engine? The key concept separating Friston's idea from traditional stochastic reinforcement learning methods and even Bayesian reinforcement learning is moving away from goal-directed optimisation.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Remember to subscribe!
