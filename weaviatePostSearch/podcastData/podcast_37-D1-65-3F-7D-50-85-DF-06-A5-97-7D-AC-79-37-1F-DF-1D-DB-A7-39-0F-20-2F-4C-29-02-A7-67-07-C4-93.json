    "Description": "<p>If there is a <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-typescript-helps-enterprise-developers/\">secret to the success</a> of TypeScript, it is in the type checking, ensuring that the data flowing through the program is of the correct kind of data. Type checking cuts down on errors, sets the stage for better tooling, and allows developers to map their programs at a higher level. And <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> itself, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, ensures that an army of JavaScript programmers can easily enjoy these advanced programming benefits with a minimal learning curve.</p><p>In this latest edition of <a href=\"/podcasts\">The New Stack Makers podcast,</a> we spoke with a few of TypeScript's designers and maintainers to learn a bit more about the design of the language: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-cavanaugh-aa4a37106/\">Ryan Cavanaugh</a>, a principal software engineering manager for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a>; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukejhoban/\">Luke Hoban</a>, chief technology officer for <a href=\"https://www.pulumi.com/\">Pulumi</a>, who was one of original creators of TypeScript, and; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rosenwasser-b56b7837/\">Daniel Rosenwasser</a>, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft. TNS editors <a href=\"/author/darryl-taft/\">Darryl Taft</a> and <a href=\"/author/joab/\">Joab Jackson</a> hosted the discussion.</p>\n",
