    "Description": "<p>Does your organization have a data culture? Richard talks with Microsoft CVP Rohan Kumar, and Mars VP Santosh Jamadagni about building organizations focused on data rather than opinion to drive the company forward. Rohan talks about getting data out of silos and into the hands of folks that can act on the information to make better business decisions. Santosh discusses how Mars has empowered workers throughout the Mars organization with real-time information. The conversation digs into the need to apply security rules to data as it enters the organization so that it is immediately available to the right people at the right time. Data availability is the key to a data culture!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server\">Microsoft Data Platform</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-synapse\">Azure Synapse Link</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/purview/\">Azure Purview</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 4, 2022</p>\n",
