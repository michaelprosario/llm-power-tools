    "Description": "<p>How do you learn PowerShell effectively? Richard chats with Jeff Hicks about his experiences teaching PowerShell from the beginning. Jeff talks about strategies to learn more about PowerShell as you code, not just searching for cut-and-paste examples. The danger of cut-and-paste is that you don't get a chance to understand what you're working on - you need to write some code to get better. This line of reasoning turns the conversation to routine learning, ensuring you're writing a little PowerShell daily to grow your skills - whether that's code you need in your work or more practice-related code. PowerShell is a superpower. You just need to learn it!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.2\">PowerShell</a></li><li><a href=\"https://developer.vmware.com/web/tool/12.7.0/vmware-powercli\">VMware PowerCLI</a></li><li><a href=\"https://powershell.org/\">PowerShell.org</a></li><li><a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/powershell\">PowerShell on Discord</a></li><li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/psprimer\">PowerShell Practice Primer</a></li><li><a href=\"https://jeffhicks.substack.com/\">Behind the PowerShell Pipeline</a></li><li><a href=\"https://jdhitsolutions.com/blog/\">Jeff's Blog</a></li></ul><p>Recorded July 26, 2022</p>\n",
