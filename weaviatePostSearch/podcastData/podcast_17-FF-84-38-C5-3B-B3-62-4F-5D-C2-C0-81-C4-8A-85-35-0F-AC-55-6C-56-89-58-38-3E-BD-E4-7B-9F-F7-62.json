    "Description": "<p>How do you manage the sprawl of Teams? Richard chats with Erica Toelle and John Gruszczyk about the governance of Teams, starting with allowing a bit of sprawl in the first place - people give up on tools that are too locked down. You have to leave room to explore! But once folks engage with Teams and the sprawl gets a bit out of control, there are tools to help you protect people and information shared there. John talks about controlling access to different parts of Teams, depending on your role in the organization and external guests. Erica dives into labeling data as sensitive and how the Data Loss Prevention tooling can help protect data and indicate where it might be exposed inappropriately. There are many approaches to controlling sprawl. You can choose what is best for your organization!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\">Microsoft Teams</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide\">Multifactor Authentication</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/solutions/groups-teams-access-governance?view=o365-worldwide\">Access Governance in Teams</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/create-test-tune-dlp-policy?view=o365-worldwide\">Data Loss Prevention Policy</a></li><li><a href=\"https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/\">Power Automate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/\">Virtual Agents</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/teams-connected-sites\">Teams and SharePoint Integration</a></li></ul><p>Recorded March 3, 2022</p>\n",
