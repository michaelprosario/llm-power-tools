    "Description": "<p>Zac Hatfield-Dodds, the Assurance Team Lead at Anthropic, speaks with host <a href= \"https://www.se-radio.net/team/gregory-kapfhammer/\">Gregory M. Kapfhammer</a> about property-based testing techniques and how to use them in an open-source tool called Hypothesis. They discuss how to define properties for a Python function and implement a test case in Hypothesis. They also explore some of the advanced features in Hypothesis that can automatically generate a test case and perform fuzzing campaigns.</p>",
