    "Description": "<p>Priority Bicycles founder Dave Weiner quit his job as a software CEO to pursue a risky idea: building a new kind of bike.&nbsp;In 2014, he started sourcing parts to make his first low-maintenance model, with a rust-proof aluminum frame and a carbon fiber belt drive instead of a chain.&nbsp;Dave was able to keep costs down by selling DTC, but had to scramble to meet demand when his first Kickstarter campaign yielded 1500 orders.&nbsp;From there, Priority pedaled forward steadily, adding new models, and partnering with hotels to provide low-maintenance bikes for guests.&nbsp;Today, after weathering the extreme whiplash of Covid and a debilitating bike accident, Dave is optimistic that Priority will keep growing, with 25 current models and sales of roughly 25,000 bikes a year.</p><p>This episode was produced by Josh Lash with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Carla Esteves\t.</p><p>Our engineers were Gilly Moon and Robert Rodriguez.</p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
