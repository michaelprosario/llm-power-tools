    "Description": "<p>When Barry Turner co-founded Lenny &amp; Larry\u2019s, the idea of selling a protein-packed breakfast muffin was practically unheard of: it was the early 1990\u2019s, and protein-fortified food was not yet a thing. But when Barry was sidelined from a promising gig as an <em>American Gladiator</em>, he and his bodybuilding buddy Benny Graham decided to infuse baked goods with protein powder and sell them around L.A. Soon they were selling brownies, cookies, and cinnamon rolls, but mostly anonymously, as a white label business.&nbsp;Barry eventually sold the company, but returned years later to build the brand he\u2019d always wanted, and to focus on one product, The Complete Cookie. Today a majority of Lenny and Larry\u2019s belongs to Lion Capital, and the high-protein cookies\u2014and other treats\u2014can be found in over 30 countries worldwide.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
