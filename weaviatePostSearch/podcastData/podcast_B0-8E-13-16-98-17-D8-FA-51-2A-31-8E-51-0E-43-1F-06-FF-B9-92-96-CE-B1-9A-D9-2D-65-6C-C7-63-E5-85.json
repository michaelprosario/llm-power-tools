    "Description": "\n        <p>In this Friday episode, host Jon Krohn talks to UCSF\u2019s David Moses about BRAVO (Brain-Computer Interface Restoration of Arm and Voice), a study led by Edward Chang and Karunesh Ganguly that helps patients who have lost the ability to speak to communicate once again via a speech neuroprosthesis. Postdoctoral engineer David Moses, who is a part of BRAVO, reveals the data and machine learning models that help BRAVO predict the words and facial expressions that a paralyzed patient is trying to form via their brain activity, crucially helping patients to communicate with medical practitioners and loved ones.<br><br>Additional materials: <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/724\">www.superdatascience.com/724</a><br><br>Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?
