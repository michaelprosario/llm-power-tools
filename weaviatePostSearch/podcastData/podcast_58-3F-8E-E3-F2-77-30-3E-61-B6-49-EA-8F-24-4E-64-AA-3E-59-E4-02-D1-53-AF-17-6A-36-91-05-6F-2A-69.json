    "Description": "  Carmen Jurado: The Power of Constructive Feedback in Building Trust in Agile Teams <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Carmen identifies the hallmark of a successful team as one that allows itself to be vulnerable. Success isn't just about positive feedback but creating an environment where team members feel safe to discuss mistakes openly. She shares an experience where a team member made an error that caused a significant project delay, prompting other team members to complain. Instead of allowing this to create division, Carmen facilitated an open discussion where the team member acknowledged their mistake and received constructive feedback from colleagues. This exchange built trust and demonstrated that the team had developed the psychological safety needed to hold each other accountable. Carmen emphasizes that this accountability for work and agreements is a responsibility that belongs to the entire team, not just the Scrum Master.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How can you foster greater psychological safety in your team so members feel comfortable addressing mistakes directly with each other?</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Golden Apples <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Carmen recommends the \"Golden Apples\" retrospective format, which draws inspiration from Greek mythology. This creative format incorporates feedback questions about sprints and the team, with game elements that introduce friendly competition. Carmen typically reserves this format for festive times of the year to boost team morale. She also mentions her fondness for movie-themed retrospectives and encourages Scrum Masters to invest time in creating fun, creative retrospective experiences that engage the team.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/prime-directive/\"> Norm Kerth\u2019s Retrospective Prime Directive</a>.</p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\ude80 Global Agile Summit 2025</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Join us in  Tallinn, Estonia, from  May 18th \u2013 20th, 2025, for an event that will inspire, challenge, and equip you with  real-world Agile success stories.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83c\udf0d Connect with global Agile leaders.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udca1 Learn practical strategies for impact.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udd25 Break free from Agile fatigue and become a Pragmatic Innovator</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/the-global-agile-summit-program/?utm_source=e1125_3_smtp\">  Check Full Program</a></p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Carmen Jurado\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Carmen describes herself as an \"agile storyteller\" and has spoken at multiple agile conferences, covering topics such as psychological safety and imposter syndrome.
