    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews ThePrimeagean. He's a software engineer who streams himself programming. He recently left his job at Netflix to stream full-time.</p> <p>We talk about: - Prime's journey from his teacher telling him he'll never accomplish anything in life to working as an engineer at one of the most prestigious tech companies. - Prime's love of \"Nintendo Hard\" video games, and how his love of challenge propelled him to \"get good\" at coding - What it's like to live stream coding in front of more than 1,000 people for a dozen hours each week - Leaving San Francisco to move his family of 6 to a horse ranch in South Dakota - Prime's thoughts on AI and how he thinks it will actually create more developer jobs than it destroys</p> <p>I had a blast talking with this guy. Though I don't agree with everything he says, I am right there with him on AI and how it's useful but over-hyped. We'll see what future versions hold and whether a \"Moore's Law of AI\" is really at work here, or whether it will plateau.</p> <p>I also agree with Prime that devs need to slow down and improve their foundational skills. There are no shortcuts to anywhere worth going.</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1996 rock song.</p> <p>Be sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend.
