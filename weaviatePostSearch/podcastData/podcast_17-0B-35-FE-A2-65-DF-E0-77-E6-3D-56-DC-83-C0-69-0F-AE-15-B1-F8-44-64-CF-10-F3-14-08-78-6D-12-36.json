    "Description": "<p>In the push to integrate data into development, time series databases have gained significant importance. These databases capture time-stamped data from servers and sensors, enabling the collection and storage of valuable information. InfluxDB, a leading open-source time series database technology by InfluxData, has partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to offer a managed open-source service for time series databases.\u00a0</p><p>Brad Bebee, General Manager of Amazon Neptune and Amazon Timestream highlighted the challenges faced by customers managing open-source Influx database instances, despite appreciating its API and performance. To address this, AWS initiated a private beta offering a managed service tailored to customer needs. Paul Dix, Co-founder and CTO of InfluxData joined Bebee, and highlighted Influx's prized utility in tracking measurements, metrics, and sensor data in real-time.\u00a0</p><p>AWS's Timestream complements this by providing managed time series database services, including TimesTen for Live Analytics and Timestream for Influx DB. Bebee emphasized the growing relevance of time series data and customers' preference for managed open-source databases, aligning with AWS's strategy of offering such services. This partnership aims to simplify database management and enhance performance for customers utilizing time series databases.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about time series databases:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/what-are-time-series-databases-and-why-do-you-need-them/\">What Are Time Series Databases, and Why Do You Need Them?</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/amazon-timestream-managed-influxdb-for-time-series-data/ Install the InfluxDB \">Amazon Timestream: Managed InfluxDB for Time Series Data\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/install-the-influxdb-time-series-database-on-ubuntu-server-22-04/\">Install the InfluxDB Time-Series Database on Ubuntu Server 22.04</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
