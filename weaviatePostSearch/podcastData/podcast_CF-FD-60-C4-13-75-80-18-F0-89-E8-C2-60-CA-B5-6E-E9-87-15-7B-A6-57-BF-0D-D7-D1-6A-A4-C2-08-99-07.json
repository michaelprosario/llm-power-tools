    "Description": "<p>Sven Johann talks with Steve McConnell about Software Estimation. Topics include when and why businesses need estimates and when they don\u2019t need them; turning estimates into a plan and validating progress on the plan; why software estimates are always full of uncertainties, what these uncertainties are and how to deal with them. They continue with: estimation, planning and monitoring a Scrum project from the beginning to a possible end. They close with estimation techniques in the large (counting, empirical data) and in the small (e.g. poker planning).</p>",
