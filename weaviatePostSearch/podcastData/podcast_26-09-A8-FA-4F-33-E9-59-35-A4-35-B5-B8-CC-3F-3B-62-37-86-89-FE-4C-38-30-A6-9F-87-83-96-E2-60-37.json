    "Description": "\n        <p>During the heigh of the pandemic, everyone was forced to go remote. But, now that offices have opened back up, leaders and staff are confronted with some challenging questions around a seemingly basic concept: Where should work happen? </p><p>Elon Musk publicly drew his own line in the sand when he declared that all Tesla employees must work \"for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week\" in-person before they could do any remote work. Failure to show up meant that they employees got fired. It's clear that Elon Musk finds remote work to be \"pretend\" work.</p><p>We don't agree with him. We do, however, think that it's important to critically examine the nature of your organization and how both in-person and remote options have their own benefits. </p><p>In this episode, you will learn-</p><ul><li>What's best about in-person and remote work options</li><li>How different organizations (and even different jobs within an organization) might have different location needs</li><li>How a hybrid system leverages the best of both worlds and how we use it as <a href=\"https://www.fullfocus.co\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Full Focus</a>.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>For more podcasts, visit <a href=\"https://leadto.win\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://leadto.win</a></p><p>To elevate your leadership, go to <a href=\"http://www.businessaccelerator.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.businessaccelerator.com</a> and schedule your free 45-minute business growth coaching call. </p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
