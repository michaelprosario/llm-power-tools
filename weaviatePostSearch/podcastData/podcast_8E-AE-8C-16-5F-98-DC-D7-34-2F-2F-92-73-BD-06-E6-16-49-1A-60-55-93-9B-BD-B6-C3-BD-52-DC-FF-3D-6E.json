    "Description": "<p>This week, Jonathan Bennett and Simon Phipps interview Neal Gompa of Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE and more. The conversation ranges from Open Source as a labor of love, to what happened at Red Hat, and why maybe it was a good thing.\u00a0 Is the age of a company as an indicator as to how they treat Open Source? Is CentOS Stream the best thing to happen to Red Hat Enterprise Linux? What was it like to be at Red Hat during that time? How does a company manage the tension between sales and engineering? We cover this and more!</p> <p>Want more?
