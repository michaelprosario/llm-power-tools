    "Description": "<p>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mlst</p>\n<p>The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact tractable given enough computational horsepower. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation.</p>\n<p>While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not uniform and have strong repeating patterns as a result of the low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world.</p>\n<p>Geometric Deep Learning unifies a broad class of ML problems from the perspectives of <strong>symmetry </strong>and <strong>invariance</strong>. These principles not only underlie the breakthrough performance of convolutional neural networks and the recent success of graph neural networks but also provide a principled way to construct new types of problem-specific inductive biases.</p>\n<p>This week we spoke with Professor Michael Bronstein (head of graph ML at Twitter) and Dr.</p>\n<p>Petar Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 (Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind), and Dr. Taco Cohen and Prof. Joan Bruna about their new proto-book Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges.</p>\n<p>See the table of contents for this (long) show at https://youtu.be/bIZB1hIJ4u8&nbsp;</p>\n",
