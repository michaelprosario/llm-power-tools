    "Description": "<p>What does Windows Server 2025 bring to Active Directory? Richard chats with Orin Thomas about the new version of Windows Server coming and what to expect around Active Directory. Orin talks about how mature the Windows Server space is, so only incremental improvements are warranted, but they are important ones - like retiring NTLM once and for all. And when it comes to Active Directory, there are new secure features you're going to want, but you do need to up your functional level to get them, and that means getting to at least Server 2016 functional level first... then moving everything else. When was the last time you transferred a FSMO role? Orin also digs into the new certification practice options available, where instead of answering questions, you do the work and get evaluated - cool!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/whats-new-windows-server-2025?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">What's New in Server 2025</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/597684/sandworm-by-andy-greenberg/\">Sandworm</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/fsmo-roles?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Active Directory FSMO Roles in Windows</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/windows-server-hybrid-administrator?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Windows Server Hybrid Administrator Associate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Windows LAPS</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 6, 2024</p>\n",
