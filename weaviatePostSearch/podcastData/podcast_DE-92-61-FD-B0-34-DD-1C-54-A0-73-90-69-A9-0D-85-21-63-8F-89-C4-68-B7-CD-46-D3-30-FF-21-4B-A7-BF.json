    "Description": "\n        <p>Dr. Dennis Gross was worried about putting his name on his skincare brand: would the word \u201cgross\u201d turn shoppers away?

Later, the brand introduced an LED face mask, which looked like C-3P0 and lit up TikTok in glowing red and blue. In 2023, after being bootstrapped for much of its existence, the business was sold to cosmetics giant Shiseido in a deal worth $450 million.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was researched and produced by Alex Cheng and edited by Neva Grant, with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
