    "Description": "\n        <p>If there's one thing that a leader is good at, then it's probably making lists. More often than not, it's a to-do list of tasks that you'll probably never finish and make you feel like you'll never catch up (because you always add more than you can check off). But, what if there were lists that made you feel good?</p><p>In this episode, we're branching out from the to-do list and providing leaders with a few other lists that might provide clarity and increase happiness and motivation. First, Megan and Joel talk about the lists that they have found the most valuable as business leaders. Then, Joel speaks with Jeremy Adam Smith, the editor of <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greater Good Magazine</a> and co-editor of <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781684034611/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gratitude Project</a>. Jeremy shares some important research on gratitude and Joel makes the case for making a gratitude list.</p><p>For more from Jeremy, visit <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greater Good Magazine</a> or pick up a copy of <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781684034611/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gratitude Project</a>!</p><p>For more podcasts, visit\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.businessaccelerator.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.businessaccelerator.com/podcast</a>.</p><p><strong>The Business Accelerator podcast is a reflection of the values and processes inside the BusinessAccelerator coaching program.
