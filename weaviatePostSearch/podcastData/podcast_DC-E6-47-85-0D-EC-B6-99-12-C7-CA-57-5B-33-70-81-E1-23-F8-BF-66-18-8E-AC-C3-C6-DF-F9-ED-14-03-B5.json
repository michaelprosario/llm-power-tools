    "Description": "<p>Agentic AI represents the next phase beyond generative AI, promising systems that not only generate content but also take autonomous actions within business processes. In a conversation recorded at Google Cloud Next, Kevin Laughridge of Deloitte explains that businesses are moving from AI pilots to production-scale deployments. Agentic AI enables decision-making, reasoning, and action across complex enterprise environments, reducing the need for constant human input.\u00a0</p><p>A key enabler is Google\u2019s newly announced open Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, which allows AI agents from different vendors to communicate and collaborate securely across platforms. Over 50 companies, including PayPal, Salesforce, and Atlassian, are already adopting it. However, deploying agentic AI at scale requires more than individual tools\u2014it demands an AI platform with runtime frameworks, UIs, and connectors. These platforms allow enterprises to integrate agents across clouds and systems, paving the way for AI that is collaborative, adaptive, and embedded in core operations. As AI becomes foundational, developers are transitioning from coding to architecting dynamic, learning systems.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights about Agent2Agent Protocol:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/googles-agent2agent-protocol-helps-ai-agents-talk-to-each-other/\">Google\u2019s Agent2Agent Protocol Helps AI Agents Talk to Each Other</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/a2a-mcp-kafka-and-flink-the-new-stack-for-ai-agents/\">A2A, MCP, Kafka and Flink: The New Stack for AI Agents</a></p><p><a>Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a></p>\n",
