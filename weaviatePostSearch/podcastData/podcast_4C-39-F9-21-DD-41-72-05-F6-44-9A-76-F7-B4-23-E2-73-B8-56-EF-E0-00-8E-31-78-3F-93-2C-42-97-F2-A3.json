    "Description": "<p></p> <p>Speech-to-text, audio, personal drawings and pictures, and writing about things kids love are all part of helping kids get excited about writing. In today's show, we talk to 15-year educator Randi Ahrndt about encouraging kids to get excited about writing as we discuss interactive writing strategies and one of the best free tools for teaching writing. We also talk about an authentic project of having kids write a personal book and the various steps of making it happen. We'll explore how to leverage technology and interactive strategies to turn even the most reluctant students into enthusiastic writers. Discover how to encourage creativity and self-expression in your classroom for all grades.</p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e869\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e869</a>\u00a0</p> <p> </p> Questions Answered in This Show: <p> </p> <ul class=\"wp-block-list\"> <li>What are the best free writing apps for classrooms, including tools like Book Creator?</li>  <li>How can teachers use interactive strategies to make writing more engaging?</li>  <li>Why is sharing writing with an authentic audience crucial for student motivation?</li>  <li>How can speech-to-text tools support struggling writers?</li>  <li>What role does student choice play in creating excitement for writing projects?</li>  <li>How do graphic organizers help students overcome writer's block?</li>  <li>How can teachers balance the demands of teaching foundational skills with writing practice?</li> </ul> <p> </p>  <p> </p> Key Takeaways: <p> </p> <ul class=\"wp-block-list\"> <li>Free Apps for Writing: Explore tools like Book Creator, Canva, and Google Docs to enable multimodal storytelling and provide accessibility options such as speech-to-text.</li>  <li>Interactive Strategies: Foster excitement with activities like project pitches, peer feedback, and sharing stories with family or classmates.</li>  <li>Practical Tips: Encourage frequent writing through journaling, passion projects, and low-pressure feedback to build confidence.</li>  <li>Authentic Experiences: Showcase student work with tools like eBooks, digital displays, and class libraries to celebrate their creativity.</li> </ul> <p></p> Sponsor: Book Creator  <p><a href= \"https://bookcreator.com/schools-districts/improving-literacy-with-book-creator?utm_campaign=CoolCatTeacher%20Oct%202024&utm_source=coolcatteacher&utm_medium=podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Book Creator\u00a0</a>is my favorite tool for teaching writing and promoting student creativity!
