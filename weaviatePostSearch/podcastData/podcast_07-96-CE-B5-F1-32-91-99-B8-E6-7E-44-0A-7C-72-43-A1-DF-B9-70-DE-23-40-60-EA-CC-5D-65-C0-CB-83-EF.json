    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Jabril. He's an indie game developer who's building a turn-based fighting game called ultrabouters.</p> <p>Jabril has developed tons of other games as well. He runs the popular Jabrils gamedev focused-YouTube. He's also published a 5-hour introduction to programming course on freeCodeCamp.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How Jabril got into gamedev as a kid when he got a copy of GameMaker - Jabril's career working at a comedy club and a radio station - The anime that Jabril's been working on for years - Jabril's advice to gamedevs who want to make a career out of building video games</p> <p>Can you guess what bass line I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 2009 song that became popular in the 2010's by being associated with a meme.</p> <p> Be sure to share this podcast with a friend. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 8,909 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
