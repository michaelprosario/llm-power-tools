    "Description": "<p>Ready for some cloud snark? Richard chats with Corey Quinn, the cloud economist and snarky commenter on all things cloud.

Getting off virtual machines and into &quot;real&quot; cloud services can help, but understanding how you are using cloud technology is critical. Lift and shift is not enough!</p>\n",
