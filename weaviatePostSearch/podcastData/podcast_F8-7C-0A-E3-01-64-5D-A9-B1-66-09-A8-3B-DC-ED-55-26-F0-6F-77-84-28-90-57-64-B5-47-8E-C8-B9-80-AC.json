    "Description": "\n        <p>Do you ever have enough hours in the day to do all you need to do? If we\u2019re honest, most of us would say no. Work, family, friends, rest, exercise, reading, relationships\u2014something\u2019s got to give. For most of us, that something is self-care.   </p> <p>The result? We give more and more to work and others, and less and less to ourselves. It\u2019s a recipe for burnout. </p> <p>But you deserve more than life on a treadmill.
