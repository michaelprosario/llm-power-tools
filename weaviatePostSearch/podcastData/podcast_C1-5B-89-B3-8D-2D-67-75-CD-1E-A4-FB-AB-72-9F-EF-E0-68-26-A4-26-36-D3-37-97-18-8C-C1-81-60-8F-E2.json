    "Description": "<p>What does it take to build a tech org from the ground up? Khawaja Shams (Co-Founder & CEO @ Momento) sits down with Anshu Narula (VP Digital Technology @ Rivian) to discuss how Anshu went from larger companies like PayPal and eBay to scaling Rivian\u2019s digital tech org from scratch. They discuss critical cultural values, early guiding principles and processes for the org, Anshu\u2019s approach to scaling the engineering teams, and a starting point if you\u2019re building from 0.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshu-narula-989161/\"><strong>ANSHU NARULA</strong></a></h2><p>At Rivian, Anshu is responsible for the strategic development of Rivian\u2019s digital ecosystem.

With more than 20 years of experience in product development, technical management and software architecture, Anshu is passionate about technology and building products that are simple, scalable and engaging.</p><blockquote><p>\"I started with my leadership team first. Next approach we took, was to go after hiring those engineers underneath them. Because I really needed coders to get through the aggressive growth phase. So those teams then hired all those engineers, once we had the architecture in place.</p><p>Then we started layering the managers to help. And started calling out the sub-functional areas. And that's when we started to add in the layer of senior managers...</p><p>- Anshu Narula\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kshams/\"><strong>KHAWAJA SHAMS</strong></a></h2><p>Khawaja <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ksshams\">(@ksshams)</a> is a technical hands-on leader, passionate about investing in people, setting a bold vision, and execution with his team.
