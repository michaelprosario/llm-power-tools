Check out these five ideas to use technology to make math exciting.</p> <p>Show Notes: <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e265\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e265</a></p> <p> This week I'll be sharing the 7 Pedagogical Shifts That Make Interactive Displays a Key to a Student-Centered Classroom on the Cool Cat Teacher blog sponsored by <a href=\"https://home.smarttech.com/\">SMART Technologies</a>.
