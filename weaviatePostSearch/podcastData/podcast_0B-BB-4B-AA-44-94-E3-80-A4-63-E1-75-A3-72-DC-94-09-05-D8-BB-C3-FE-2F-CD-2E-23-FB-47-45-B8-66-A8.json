    "SourceUrl": "https://runasradio.com/Shows/Show/807",
    "Description": "<p>Does your organization need hybrid identities? Richard talks to Sonia Cuff about Hybrid Active Directory, connecting your on-premises Active Directory infrastructure to M365 and Azure. There's essentially no choice in larger organizations - too many identities and applications exist that replicating identities would be a huge problem. But what about a small organization? Sonia talks about folks living in the Small Business Server and Windows Essential worlds that really could make a go of moving entirely in the cloud without hybrid - but it all comes down to applications that the organization needs. The conversation also digs into modern identity using password managers and authenticators - even going passwordless!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect\">Azure AD Connect</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune\">Microsoft Intune</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-arc/\">Azure Arc</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app\">Microsoft Authenticator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/security/business/identity-access-management/passwordless-authentication\">Passwordless Identity</a></li></ul><p>Recorded November 25, 2021</p>\n",
