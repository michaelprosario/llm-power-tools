Our special guest, Or-Tal Kiriati from Tel Aviv, Israel, shares her innovative approach to integrating artificial intelligence and human experiences into multidisciplinary projects. From exploring the duality of human nature through literature (and a super amazing way to teach Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) to teaching friendship skills in a digital age, Or-Tal's projects offer a fresh perspective on education. Learn from her techniques in her language arts classroom to see how you can engage your students, encourage critical thinking, and make learning an adventure!</p> <p>Show transcript, notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/815\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/815</a></p> <p>Show Sponsor:\u00a0Are you looking for engaging NGSS-aligned science lessons designed to improve critical thinking in your middle school students?
