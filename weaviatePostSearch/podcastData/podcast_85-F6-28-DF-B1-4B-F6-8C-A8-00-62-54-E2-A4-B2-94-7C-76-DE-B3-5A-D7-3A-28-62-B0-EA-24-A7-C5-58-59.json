    "Description": "<p>Self-paced mastery-based learning has many misconceptions and misunderstandings about how it is being implemented. Today's guest, Joe Manfre, a math teacher from Hawaii, has been using this teaching method and has seen a positive improvement in his classroom in terms of student learning and empowerment. Joe clearly shares how self-paced learning is not about replacing the teacher with videos, but using instructional videos as a baseline of knowledge that can be accesssed both inside and outside the classroom. Joe also talks about formative instructional approaches in the classroom and the importance of balancing self-paced and collaborative structures in the classroom. Whether you're using this approach or just parts of it, you'll find benefits in listening to this episode.</p> <p>Show notes and full transcript: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e848\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e848</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Show Sponsor: Modern Classrooms Project helps teachers bring engaging, exciting teaching to their classrooms.
