    "Description": "<p>Chris Cravens (Former VPE @ Splunk and CIO @ Uber) shares practical tips for applying professional strategies / tech performance tools into our personal lives - to increase intentionality, goal setting, and habit formation in all aspects of our lives. He shares why it\u2019s so easy to dedicate 90% of your time & attention to work while only dedicating 10% to your personal life and reveals from his own experience how he discovered a better work-life balance by applying OKRs, goal setting, postmortems, and deep reflection. We also cover frameworks for identifying feeling-based goals, building habits & accountability within your personal life, combating negative self-talk, and rewiring your brain to focus on the present & not dwell on past failures.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cravens/\"><strong>CHRIS CRAVENS</strong></a></h2><p>Chris Cravens is an industry veteran with a quarter century of successes delivering measurable value for high-growth enterprises in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

There are people who have much healthier outlooks, and I've just never been wired that way. So I have to kind of question each decision I make as I go to do a new thing or take on more stuff. 'Is this the right thing for me to do right now, or am I making my life harder?'\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Chris Cravens \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>We\u2019re less than one week away from <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/glow/?utm_source=elc&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=glow-2024-promo&utm_content=text&utm_term=register\">GLOW 2024</a></h3><p>Attend GLOW 2024 - <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/\">Jellyfish\u2019s</a> virtual summit for engineering, product, and finance leaders who are looking to deliver greater business impact while building great software and teams.
