    "Description": "Programmer Earl Bey has always been a hip hop fan. He\u2019s been rapping since he was ten, and even had his own manager. When he was later introduced to tech, he dove into coding full time. Now, he blends his new passion for code with his love for hip hop. He talks about how he uses rap to retain new programming concepts, and gives us a taste of his lyrical skills in a performance of code-infused rhymes on FizzBuzz and Rails.
