    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Rory McCaw of Infront Consulting about the System Center 2012 suite. The conversation starts with the starting point of System Center - Configuration Manager or Operations Manager, depending on the focus of your organization. From there, the entire suite is explored, including Virtual Machine Manager, Orchestrator, Service Manager, Data Protection Manager, Endpoint Protection and App Controller. Rory explains how the different parts of System Center fit together and why you want to slowly add each product to your organization. This is about getting to preventative IT rather than constantly battling the crises!</p>\n",
