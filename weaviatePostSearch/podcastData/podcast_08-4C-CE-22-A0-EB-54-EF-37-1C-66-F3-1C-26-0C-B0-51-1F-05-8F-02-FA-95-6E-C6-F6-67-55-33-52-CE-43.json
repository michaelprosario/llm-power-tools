    "Description": "  Joel Bancroft-Connors: Sustainable Value\u2014Redefining Success Beyond Profit <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Joel has evolved his definition of Scrum Master success over time, moving beyond traditional metrics to focus on what truly matters: sustainable value delivery. While Agile principles clearly state the goal of delivering value continuously, Joel emphasizes that success isn't just about making profit - it's about creating sustainable profit through sustainable processes and people practices. He challenges Scrum Masters to consider their \"people sustainability metric\" and asks whether their approach supports long-term team health and organizational resilience. Joel's definition encompasses three pillars: delivering sustainable value, maintaining sustainable processes, and ensuring sustainability for people. This holistic view of success requires Scrum Masters to think beyond immediate outcomes and consider the long-term impact of their practices.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to the book <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4dAeAsj\"> Turn the ship around! by David Marquet</a>.\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  What is your people sustainability metric, and how are you measuring whether your Scrum practices support long-term team and organizational health?</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Back to Basics <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Joel advocates for returning to the foundational retrospective format outlined in \"Agile Retrospectives\" by Derby and Larsen. Rather than getting caught up in complex or creative retrospective techniques, he emphasizes the power of following the basic steps: set the stage, gather data, generate insights, decide what to do, and close the retrospective. Joel stresses that there's an important arc to retrospectives that shouldn't be overlooked. By taking time to properly gather data and following the structured approach from the agile retrospectives book, teams can achieve more meaningful and actionable outcomes. Sometimes the most effective approach is simply executing the fundamentals exceptionally well.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to the book <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4mA7jga\"> Agile retrospectives, by Derby and Larsen</a>.\u00a0</p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\ude80 Global Agile Summit 2025</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Join us in  Tallinn, Estonia, from  May 18th \u2013 20th, 2025, for an event that will inspire, challenge, and equip you with  real-world Agile success stories.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83c\udf0d Connect with global Agile leaders.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udca1 Learn practical strategies for impact.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udd25 Break free from Agile fatigue and become a Pragmatic Innovator</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/the-global-agile-summit-program/?utm_source=e1125_3_smtp\">  Check Full Program</a></p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Joel Bancroft-Connors</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Joel Bancroft-Connors is The Gorilla Coach \u2014 a Certified Scrum Trainer and Agile disruptor focused on sustainable value and effectiveness.
