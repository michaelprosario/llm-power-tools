    "Description": "<p><strong>Chris Love</strong>, co-author of the book <em><a href= \"https://www.manning.com/books/core-kubernetes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-testid=\"link-with-safety\">Core Kubernetes</a></em>, joins host <a href= \"https://se-radio.net/team/robert-blumen/\">Robert Blumen</a> for a conversation about kubernetes security. Chris identifies the node layer, secrets management, the network layer, contains, and pods as the most critical areas to be addressed.</p> <p>The conversation explores a range of topics, including when to accept defaults and when to override; differences between self-managed clusters and cloud-service provider-managed clusters; and what can go wrong at each layer -- and how to address these issues. They further discuss managing the node layer; network security best practices; kubernetes secrets and integration with cloud-service provider secrets; container security; pod security, and Chris offers his views on policy-as-code frameworks and scanners.</p> <p>Brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IEEE Computer Society</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.computer.org/software\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">IEEE Software magazine</a>.</p>",
