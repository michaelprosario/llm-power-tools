    "Description": "  Xmas Special: Running Experiments Over Managing A Tasklist, aka The Backlog With Vasco Duarte <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  In the third episode of the \u201c5 Wishes for 2025\u201d series, Vasco Duarte takes aim at one of the most common anti-patterns in software development: the obsession with managing tasks instead of discovering what truly works.\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  He calls on teams to shift their mindset from backlog management to running experiments, creating a culture of learning and rapid innovation.</p>   From Backlog Secretary to Product Scientist <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cManaging a backlog is like planning a road trip by focusing on the gas stops instead of the destination.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco reflects on how teams often lose sight of their goals, becoming bogged down in task management instead of pursuing real customer value. He humorously compares this approach to being a \u201cbacklog secretary,\u201d organizing tasks while forgetting why the project began in the first place.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  His solution? A radical shift from task obsession to a learning-first approach driven by rapid experiments.</p>   The Power of 24-Hour Experiments <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cWhy wait for weeks to learn something you could test in a day?\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco shares real-world success stories of teams embracing a rapid experimentation mindset:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u2022  The Skeptical Client:  In just 48 hours, this team launched two market experiments and gained actionable feedback.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u2022  The Experiment-First Startup:  Meeting twice weekly to design and run experiments, this startup learns more in a week than most teams do in a month.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  These examples showcase how rapid testing leads to faster learning and greater customer impact.</p>   The Build-Measure-Learn Framework <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cOr as I like to call it, the \u2018Question-Experiment-Insight\u2019 cycle \u2013 it\u2019s like having a GPS for product development.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco introduces a three-step approach to running experiments:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 16pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  1.  Start with a Concrete Goal:  Define measurable business targets using a Business Value Equation.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 16pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  2.  Create a Metrics Tree:  Break down goals into daily metrics that track progress.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 16pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  3.  Experiment, Experiment, Experiment:  Test new features, tweaks, and ideas quickly to gain insights and adjust course.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  He highlights a team\u2019s transformation from a \u201cfeature factory\u201d to \u201cexperiment mode,\u201d where the Product Owner posed questions and the team creatively solved them. This cycle drives meaningful insights instead of aimless task completion.</p>   A Wish for 2025: From Features to Insights <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cA backlog full of tasks is like a restaurant full of recipes \u2013 it means nothing until you know what your customers actually want to eat!\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco\u2019s third wish for 2025 is a world where teams prioritize learning over task management. By embracing the \u201cQuestion-Experiment-Insight\u201d cycle, teams can focus on solving customer problems and creating real value.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  This mindset shift transforms teams from task managers into product scientists, driving faster, smarter innovation.</p>   See It in Action: Global Agile Summit 2025 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cWant to learn how real teams are running experiments and making an impact?
