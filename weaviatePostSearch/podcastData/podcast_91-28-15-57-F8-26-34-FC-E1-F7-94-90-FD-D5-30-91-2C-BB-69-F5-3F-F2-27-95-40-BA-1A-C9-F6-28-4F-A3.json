    "Description": "<p>It's episode 900! Richard brings friend Dana Epp onto the show to talk a bit about the last one hundred episodes of RunAs Radio - and a little look to the future as well. With Dana around, you know there will be lots of security conversation. Over the past hundred shows, ransomware has had quite the story arc, especially around Exchange Server and other products. The conversation then turns to more future-looking topics, including the various Microsoft Copilots being built - could these be tools to help sysadmins? Probably a topic for episode 1000!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview\">Windows Sandbox</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva\">Microsoft Viva</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-data-loss-prevention\">Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention</a></li></ul><p>Recorded September 15, 2023</p>\n",
