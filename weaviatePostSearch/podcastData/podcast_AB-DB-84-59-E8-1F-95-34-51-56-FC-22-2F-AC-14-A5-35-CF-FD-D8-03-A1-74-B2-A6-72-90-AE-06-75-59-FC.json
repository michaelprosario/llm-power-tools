    "Description": "<p>Dr. Brad Johnson (@DrBradJohnson) talks about five things that harm a student's ability to succeed. Brad teaches graduate-level leadership courses and other educational courses and is the author of six books.\u00a0</p> <p>Today, he shares with us the things we do to harm student success.</p> <p>First, he discusses the disservice of a sedentary lifestyle.</p> <p>Second, he talks about what happens to kids when adults expect them to learn like adults.</p> <p>Third, he discusses an important point with several applications for schools that more is not better. This has implications for how we teach math to even how we inspire creativity.</p> <p>Fourth, he talks about core strength and the problems we're having because today's students don't have it like their ancestors. (Only 1 in 12 of today's students have the core strength and balance of those in the 1980's.) He also discusses how it impacts their focus, organization, and executive functioning.</p> <p>Finally, Brad talks about teamwork and how students should be taught to be team players but what we must do to let that happen.</p> <p>A full transcript of this show and the show notes are available at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast\">www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast</a> as well as details on entering this month\u2019s giveaway contests.</p>",
