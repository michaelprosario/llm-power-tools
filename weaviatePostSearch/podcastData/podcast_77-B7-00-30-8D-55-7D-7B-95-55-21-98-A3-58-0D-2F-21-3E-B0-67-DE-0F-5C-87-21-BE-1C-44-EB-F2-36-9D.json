    "Description": "<p>As a previous TEDx Orlando organizer and leader, I am asked a lot about how to land a TEDx speaking opportunity. I thought it best to bring an expert that can share that knowledge with us. I know Adam Lewis Walker from one of my favorite events - Podfest. He has been exhibiting and speaking at that event for years. Adam helps authors, coaches, consultants, and speakers become the thought leader in their niche via his TalkXcelerator method to land and deliver TEDx talks that amplify impact and authority.</p>\n<p>In this episode you will learn more about the TEDx process and some inside tips about landing a talk. His 5 words that describe are interesting. 1) Relentlessness, 2) Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning change for the better or continuous improvement, 3) Pole vaulter shooting for the Olympics, 4) Family, 5) Legacy .The Kaizen concept is an interesting term that makes one pause and realize the value of continuous improvement and a definite ice breaker conversation starter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His book, entitled \u201cAwaken Your Alpha,'' focuses on awareness, action, and ascension. You can find his book on Amazon. There is a press release about to publish a list of thought leaders Marquis Whos Who in America and Adam was thrilled to be recognized and receive an award.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His best mentoring advice came from his book. Ikigai is a Japanese concept referring to something that gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. Similar to a venn diagram, this diagram shows ikigai as the convergence of four areas of life: what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. The very center, where each area overlaps, is your ikigai \u2013 your reason for getting up and where you should focus your efforts to find ultimate fulfillment.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Intern Whisperer Podcast is brought to you by Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
