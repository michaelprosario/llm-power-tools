Looking at Syrian Refugee students in Lebanon, we are spotlighting students who need our encouragement and help. This is not an easy topic, but we should all consider.

Karkouti - Bio as Submitted <p>Ibrahim M. Karkouti is an independent thinker, a young scholar, and a life-long learner who recently defended his doctoral dissertation at the University of Hartford, CT - USA. Ten years of professional experience in Lebanon, Qatar, and the United States have taught Ibrahim that learning has no boundaries and that education matters the most when it is used to remedy the deleterious effects of segregation, racism, sectarianism, and other forms of discriminatory practices that prevent historically excluded populations from attaining their basic rights to education, healthcare, and prosperity. Karkouti\u2019s research focuses on diversity issues in higher education, the elements that aid in the facilitation of the use of technology in the classroom and the types of social support K-12 teachers need to embrace and implement reform.</p> <p>Twitter: @<a href= \"https://www.twiter.com/ibrahimkarkouti\">ibrahimkarkouti</a></p> <p>Linked: <a class=\"text-blue underline focus-visible\" href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-m-karkouti-30938696/\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-m-karkouti-30938696/</a></p> <p>Restoring Hope for Syrian Refugees: Social Support Students Need to Excel at School <a class=\"text-blue underline focus-visible\" href= \"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imig.12642\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imig.12642</a></p> <p><em>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
