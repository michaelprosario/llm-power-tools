    "Description": "\n        <p>Reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) has come a long way. In this episode, research scientist Nathan Lambert talks to Jon Krohn about the technique\u2019s origins of the technique. He also walks through other ways to fine-tune LLMs, and how he believes generative AI might democratize education.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by AWS Inferentia (<a href=\"https://go.aws/3zWS0au\">go.aws/3zWS0au</a>) and AWS Trainium (<a href=\"https://go.aws/3ycV6K0\">go.aws/3ycV6K0</a>), and Crawlbase (<a href=\"https://crawlbase.com\">crawlbase.com</a>), the ultimate data crawling platform.
