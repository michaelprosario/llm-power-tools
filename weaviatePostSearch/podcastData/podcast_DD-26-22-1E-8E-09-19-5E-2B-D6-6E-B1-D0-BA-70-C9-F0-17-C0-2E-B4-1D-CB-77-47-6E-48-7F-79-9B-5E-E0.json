    "Description": "<p>How are you protecting your organization's data? Richard chats with Joanne Klein about her work with Microsoft Purview to help with data protection, management, and governance. Joanne talks about a spike in data protection concerns from Microsoft Copilot - if you have been securing data through obscurity, you're in for a nasty surprise! Copilot has a knack for finding every nook and cranny of data. Proper data protection also means effective archiving - getting rid of out-of-date or irrelevant data. And then there are the security concerns around data retention - how do you need to keep, and for how long? Microsoft Purview can help with all these problems, but you must work with leadership to get things right!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products/purview\">Microsoft Purview</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/dlp-adaptive-protection-learn?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Adaptive Prevention in Purview</a></li></ul><p>Recorded June 10, 2024</p>\n",
