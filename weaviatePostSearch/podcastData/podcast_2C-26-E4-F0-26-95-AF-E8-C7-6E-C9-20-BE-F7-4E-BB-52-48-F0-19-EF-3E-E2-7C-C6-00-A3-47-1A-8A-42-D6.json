    "Description": "<p>Inga Petryaevskaya, the visionary CEO and Founder of ShapesXR, joins the podcast to share her inspiring journey from her early career in machine learning at Siemens to leading a pioneering VR collaboration platform. With a deep-rooted passion for technology and innovation, Inga discusses how ShapesXR is revolutionizing the way we design and collaborate in immersive environments.</p><p>Starting with her background, Inga explains how her work at Siemens involved early applications of machine learning, such as predicting flooding in Amsterdam. This experience laid the groundwork for her understanding of how emerging technologies can solve real-world problems. Transitioning to the VR industry, she founded ShapesXR to address the challenges of explaining complex ideas and designs in immersive, three-dimensional spaces.</p><p>ShapesXR, Inga elaborates, is designed to enhance collaborative design processes by allowing teams to prototype, iterate, and visualize ideas in real time. The platform's versatility is highlighted through various use cases, including designing XR applications, creating digital twins for real-world events, and even designing fashion items. By enabling rapid prototyping and integrating storytelling elements, ShapesXR supports a wide range of industries, from healthcare training to retail and fashion.</p><p>Inga also addresses the broader XR landscape, noting the significant potential of AI to further accelerate and enhance VR experiences. She envisions AI as a powerful tool for rapid prototyping, environment generation, and co-ideation, making the design process more efficient and intuitive. This integration aligns with ShapesXR\u2019s mission to democratize access to immersive design tools and foster innovation.</p><p>The upcoming release of ShapesXR 2.0 marks a significant milestone for the platform. Inga reveals that the new version will be a truly cross-platform product, supporting various devices and input methods. This upgrade includes a redesigned UI, procedural primitives for shaping any object, and enhanced performance optimizations. The goal is to provide a seamless and scalable experience for users, regardless of the device or input method they use.</p><p>Reflecting on the state of the XR industry, Inga emphasizes the importance of patience and resilience. The market is challenging but filled with potential, especially as more companies recognize the value of immersive technologies. She highlights the supportive nature of the XR community, sharing anecdotes of collaboration and mutual encouragement among industry pioneers.</p><p>Inga concludes by expressing her excitement for the future of ShapesXR and the broader XR industry. She believes that immersive technologies will play a crucial role in shaping the future of design, collaboration, and user experiences. Her vision for ShapesXR is to continue evolving and meeting the needs of a rapidly changing technological landscape.</p>\n<p><p>Have any comments or questions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show Feedback@Buildingtheopenmetaverse.org</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Want more information?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Visit our website www.buildingtheopenmetaverse.org&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And make sure you follow us on Linkedin for all of our show updates&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/company/buildingtheopenmetaverse&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building the Open Metaverse is a podcast hosted by Patrick Cozzi (Cesium) and Marc Petit that invites a broad range of technical experts to share their insights on how the community is building the metaverse together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>#BuildingTheOpenMetaversePodcast #MetaversePodcast #Metaverse</p></p>",
