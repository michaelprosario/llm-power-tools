    "Description": "<p>This week join Dr. Tim Scarfe, Yannic Kilcher, and Keith Duggar have a conversation with Dr. Rebecca Roache in the last of our 3-part series on the social dilemma Netflix film. Rebecca is a senior lecturer in philosophy at Royal Holloway, university of London and has written extensively about the future of friendship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>People claim that friendships are not what they used to be. People are always staring at their phones, even when in public &nbsp;Social media has turned us into narcissists who are always managing our own PR rather than being present with each other. Anxiety about the negative effects of technology are as old as the written word. Is technology bad for friendships? Can you have friends through screens? Does social media cause polarization? And is that a bad thing? Does it promote quantity over quality? Rebecca thinks that social media and echo chambers are less ominous to friendship on closer inspection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:32 Teaser clip from Rebecca and her new manuscript on friendship</p>\n<p>00:02:52 Introduction&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:04:56 Memorisation vs reasoning / is technology enhancing friendships&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:09:29 Word of warcraft / gaming communities / echo chambers / polarisation&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:12:34 Horizontal vs Vertical social attributes&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:17:18 Exclusion of others opinions&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:20:36 The power to silence others / truth verification&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:23:58 Misinformation&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:27:28 Norms / memes / political terms and co-opting / bullying&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:31:57 Redefinition of political terms i.e. racism&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:36:13 Virtue signalling&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:38:57 How many friends can you have / spread thin / Dunbars 150&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:42:54 Is it morally objectionable to believe or contemplate objectionable ideas, punishment&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:50:52 Is speaking the same thing as acting &nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:52:24 Punishment - deterrence vs retribution / historical&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:53:59 Yannic: contemplating is a form of speaking&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:57:32 silencing/blocking is intellectual laziness - what ideas are we allowed to talk about&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:04:53 Corporate AI ethics frameworks&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:09:14 Autonomous Vehicles&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:10:51 the eternal Facebook world / online vs offline friendships&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:14:05 How do we get the best out of our online friendships&nbsp;</p>\n",
