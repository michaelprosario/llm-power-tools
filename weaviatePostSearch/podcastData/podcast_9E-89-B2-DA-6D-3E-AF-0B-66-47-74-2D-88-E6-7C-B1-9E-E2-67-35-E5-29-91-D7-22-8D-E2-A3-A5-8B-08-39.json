    "Description": "<p>We have a conversation with Christina Wick, CTO @ Flowcode, on the current state of the gender gap in tech and what we can do as engineering leaders to actively bridge that gap. We cover stories of the historical impact of women in tech as well as what you can do to remove bias in interviews, performance reviews and feedback. Plus what you can do to intervene when you observe bias happening.</p><p><i>\"The first time I heard someone talking about how \"women should seek executive sponsorship\" I got really annoyed... The term executive sponsor in project management usually means the C-level executive that sponsors or is responsible for the project. So like, why do women need an executive sponsor? I'm not some project! But then I thought about it... And men sponsor men all the time! We just don't label it that.\"</i><br />\u00a0</p><p><strong>ABOUT CHRISTINA WICK</strong></p><p>Christina was previously VP of Engineering at Harry\u2019s, a successful next-generation CPG company.
