    "Description": "<p>Larry Ferlazzo @larryferlazzo discusses classroom management. Today, for Thought Leader Thursday, we're thinking about how we can all improve our classroom management skills. Larry shares tips from an \"old pro\" about how we can create a more successful classroom environment. (And a word on if it ever gets easier.)</p> <p>In today's Show, Larry discusses:</p> <ul> <li>The first ingredient in successful classroom management</li> <li>The important question we must ask ourselves about everything we do in the classroom</li> <li>How to encourage intrinsic motivation</li> <li>Something that happened in his classroom this week and how he handled it</li> <li>Larry's feelings on if he's \"arrived\" or if teaching is still hard even when you're a \"pro\"</li> </ul> <p>Larry Ferlazzo has taught English Language Learner, mainstream, and International Baccalaureate classes at Luther Burbank High School in Sacramento, California, for thirteen years.</p> <p>He has <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2nywIeZ\">written eight books</a> on student motivation, classroom management, and English Language Learners.</p> <p>He writes a popular resource sharing blog for teachers, a weekly advice column for Education Week Teacher, and contributes regular columns on education issues to The New York Times and The Washington Post. He also hosts a weekly BAM! radio show. Larry is an adjunct faculty member at California State University, Sacramento and the University of California, Davis.</p> <p>He was a community organizer for nineteen years prior to becoming a teacher. Lastly, a basketball team he plays for has come in last place every year since 2014, so he should not give up his day job for a career in sports.</p> <p>A full transcript of this show and the show notes are available at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast\">www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast</a> as well as details on entering this month\u2019s giveaway contests.</p>",
