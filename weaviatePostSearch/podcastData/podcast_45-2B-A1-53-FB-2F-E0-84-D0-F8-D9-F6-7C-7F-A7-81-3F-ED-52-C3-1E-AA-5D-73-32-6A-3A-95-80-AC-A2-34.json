    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>Matt takes us back to the origins of his open source days and the spark that inspired his love for engineering \u2014 including the point at which he discovered Linux.</p><p>He shares how he began learning from the code itself, which was ultimately a different style of learning than what was available to him at university. Then, it was to the stacks, but not Stack Overflow. Think Barnes and Noble, not YouTube videos.</p><p>Imagine trying to\u00a0 navigate getting your first engineering job during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble\">the dot-com crash of the late 90s and early 2000s</a>.</p><p>We reflect on Matt's experience building projects with his daughter, including an AI-powered doorbell he built himself.</p><p>Speaking of insatiable curiousity, we\u2019d like to give a big high five to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1639825/wonton\">Wonton</a>, who received the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4128/inquisitive\">Inquisitive Badge</a>. Thanks for coming on 30 separate days to maintain a positive question track record.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"http://matthicksj\">Matt</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benpopper\">Ben</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cassidoo\">Cassidy</a>.</p>\n",
