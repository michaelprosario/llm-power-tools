    "Description": "  Karen Suarez: \"You're Not Listening\": A Scrum Master's Wake-Up Call <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karen shares a valuable learning experience when she pushed her team too hard to split user stories and change their story writing approach. The team's feedback was direct: \"You are not listening.\" This moment taught Karen several important lessons: not everyone is ready for change at the same time, resistance often contains valuable information about our own actions, and the Scrum Master isn't always the one who knows better. Karen emphasizes the importance of giving yourself time to pause, reflect, and adapt to the team's current situation. She also discovered how the product backlog can serve as a powerful communication tool when used properly.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to the book <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3FkZlXr\"> Start With Why by Simon Sinek</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  When was the last time you received pushback from your team, and what information might that resistance be telling you about your own approach?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Karen Suarez\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karen is a dedicated Scrum Master with a long experience driving agile transformations and fostering high-performing teams. She is passionate about continuous learning, and excels in aligning agile practices with organizational innovation.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  You can link with <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://fr.linkedin.com/in/karen-suarez-22836286\"> Karen Suarez on LinkedIn</a>.</p>",
