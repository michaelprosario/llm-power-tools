    "Description": "<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to interview Safia Porter and hope you do also. She is warm, caring, and visionary.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She actually selected the same word to describe herself.\u00a0 Safia shared a story from her childhood about her love for the performing arts &amp; music. She believes it helps to awaken our imagination and we should all lean into our inner child. I totally agree with her and have experienced a direct relationship with music and how it impacts my emotions. What about you?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her life is spent on making a positive impact in the world. She is part of an organization called <em>Easy Water for Everyone</em>. Here is a sobering question - Think about drinking water that is brown?\u00a0</p>\n<p>That should make you pause for a moment. There are 663 million people in the world that lack access to clean water. <em>Easy Water for Everyone</em> delivers clean pure water to remote villages with contaminated water sources. They use simple sustainable technology that does not require electricity and is validated by research. This makes the water safe to consume.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are now 35 village sites with these water filtration devices in developing countries to provide clean drinking water to the villagers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do you want to make an impact?\u00a0 You can, Safia shared that there will be a Water &amp; Health conference in October 2024 at University of North Carolina. The theme is \u201cImagine a Day Without Water.\u201d https://www.easywaterforeveryone.org/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lastly, one of my favorite questions is what is the best mentoring advice she would like to share. She took us back to advice her father gave her. \u201cKeep going no matter what life gives you.\u201d\u00a0 Like Dory - just keep swimming.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
