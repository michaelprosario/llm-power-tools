    "Description": "<p>This week Jonathan Bennett and <a href= \"https://mastodon.social/@methoddan\">Dan Lynch</a> sit down with Andy Stewart to talk about Andy's Ham Radio Linux (AHRL)! It's the Linux disto designed to give hams the tools they need to work with their radios. What's it like to run a niche Linux distro? How has Andy managed to keep up with this for over a decade? And what's the big announcement about the project breaking today? Listen to find out!</p> <p>You can join the conversation in\u00a0<a href= \"https://discord.gg/GNeFvChvnz?event=1217585022589206670\">the Hackaday Discord</a>, where the show records live each week, as well as getting the full story and show links from Hackaday.
