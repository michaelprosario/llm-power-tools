    "Description": "<p>Are your docs part of your DevOps cycle? Richard chats with Mattias Karlsson about automating documentation for APIs, cloud resources, and more! Mattias talks about using tools to build text files that contain every Azure resource being utilized, hopefully per application, along with API info, NuGet packages, and more. He also digs into the different audiences for that documentation - business wants to know what website exist, both interior and publically facing. Operations need to know what resources are consumed on-premises and in the cloud. Development is always looking for versions of APIs, calling approaches, etc. Maintaining documentation by hand is tedious and perpetually out-of-date. But if you can get up to speed with the tooling, you can make your documentation generate at the speed of deployment!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Bicep</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/devlead/ARI\">Azure Resource Inventory</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azureWT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Azure CLI</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pulumi.com/\">Pulumi</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 29, 2024</p>\n",
