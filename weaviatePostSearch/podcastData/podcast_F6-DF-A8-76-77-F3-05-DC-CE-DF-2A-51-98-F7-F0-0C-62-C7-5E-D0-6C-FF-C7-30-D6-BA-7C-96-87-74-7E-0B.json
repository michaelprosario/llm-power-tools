    "Description": "\n        <p>Does your team know what winning looks like? If not, you\u2019re going to be frustrated that they\u2019re \u201cnot doing their job,\u201d and they\u2019re going to be frustrated because they don\u2019t know what success even looks like. You as the leader must clearly communicate the expectations so that your team can win. On this episode of The EntreLeadership Podcast, we sit down with BELAY CEO Tricia Sciortino. She tells us her story of how she went from assistant to CEO and how clear role expectations and a growth path got her there. Then, in our second segment, George Kamel sits down with RamseyTrusted Senior Executive Vice President Herb Jenkins to talk about how to create key result areas for your team members.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/shows/the-entreleadership-podcast\"> <em>The EntreLeadership Podcast</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3mRIqQt\">BELAY\u2019s website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://apple.co/3BScyiP\"><em>One Next Step</em></a> podcast</p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DlmBP8\">Download Key Result Areas (KRAs) template.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3bJOSmi\">Schedule a call with Tim, our producer</a>.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Learn more about <strong>EntreLeadership Events:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/shows/summit?utm_source=podcast_entreleadership&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=summit_podcast_promo&amp;utm_term=entreleadership_bu&amp;utm_campaign=summit_podcast&amp;campaign_id=&amp;lead_source=Digital_Content\"> EntreLeadership Summit</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/shows/ems?utm_source=podcast_entreleadership&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=ems_podcast_promo&amp;utm_term=entreleadership_bu&amp;utm_campaign=ems_podcast&amp;campaign_id=&amp;lead_source=Digital_Content\"> EntreLeadership Master Series</a></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p>Learn more about <strong>EntreLeadership Coaching:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/business/entreleadership/elite-coaching/self-guided-training?utm_source=podcast_entreleadership&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=elite_podcast_promo&amp;utm_term=entreleadership_bu&amp;utm_campaign=elite&amp;campaign_id=&amp;lead_source=Digital_Content\"> Elite</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/business/entreleadership/elite-coaching/advisory-groups?utm_source=podcast_entreleadership&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=advisory_groups_podcast_promo&amp;utm_term=entreleadership_bu&amp;utm_campaign=Advisory_Groups&amp;campaign_id=&amp;lead_source=Digital_Content\"> Advisory Groups</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/business/entreleadership/elite-coaching/executive-coaching?utm_source=podcast_entreleadership&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=executive_coaching_podcast_promo&amp;utm_term=entreleadership_bu&amp;utm_campaign=executive_coaching&amp;campaign_id=&amp;lead_source=Digital_Content\"> Executive Coaching</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/business/entreleadership/workshops?utm_source=podcast_entreleadership&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=workshops_podcast_promo&amp;utm_term=entreleadership_bu&amp;utm_campaign=workshops_podcast&amp;campaign_id=&amp;lead_source=Digital_Content\"> Workshops</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/business/entreleadership/weekly-report?utm_source=podcast_entreleadership&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_content=weekly_report_tool_podcast_promo&amp;utm_term=entreleadership_bu&amp;utm_campaign=weekly_report_tool_podcast&amp;campaign_id=&amp;lead_source=Digital_Content\"> Weekly Report Tool</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Learn more about the offers from our <strong>EntreLeadership Partners</strong><strong>:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3epUiVK\">BELAY</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://lp.gravysolutions.io/entreleadership\">Gravy</a> | <a href=\"https://www.hitedigital.com/entreleadership/\">Hite Digital</a> | <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3EHSO46\">NetSuite</a></p>\n      ",
