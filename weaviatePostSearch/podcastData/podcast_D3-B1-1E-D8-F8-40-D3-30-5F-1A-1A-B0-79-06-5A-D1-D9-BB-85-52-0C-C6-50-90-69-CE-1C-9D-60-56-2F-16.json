    "Description": "<p>What IT certifications do you hold? Richard chats with Greg Shields about the value proposition behind various IT certifications. In the fast moving software industries, it's pretty difficult to effectively measure the capabilities of someone. The conversation digs into the purpose behind an IT exam, and the dangers of focusing purely on an exam, rather than the body of work the exam represents. Greg discusses Microsoft certifications and the latest software for helping to talk broadly about your skills - and what it means for your work and opportunities!</p>\n",
