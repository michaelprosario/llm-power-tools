    "Description": "<p>So what is a reporting ecosystem? Richard chats with David Pless about the modern Microsoft reporting ecosystem, which can involve SQL Server Reporting Servers, Excel and the new Power BI tools. David talks about how you can work from the space you're most familiar with, and still be able to move data and reports between the different tools. But they aren't the same - different tools for different purposes. Power BI is the relative new comer and brings the power of the cloud to reporting, but the latest offerings are also available on-premises as well. Lots of reporting choices!</p>\n",
