If you only see it as something to win, that means you\u2019re going to lose a lot more.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWho wants to be around the person who always has to be right? That is somebody who is lonely.\u201d</li><li>\u201cInstead of seeing arguments as something to win, you see them as something to unravel.\u201d</li><li>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it. You just gotta understand it.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThat\u2019s the key with connection: I can disagree with you and still connect with you. I can still be unhappy, I can still be mad at you, and still connect with you.\u201d</li><li>\u201cYou are in complete control of the pace of the conversation.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t say it with control, you end up reacting rather than responding. It\u2019s just your natural fight or flight will take over and you\u2019re going to start responding more emotionally.\u201d</li><li>\u201cYou gotta let them pour it all out before they\u2019ll ever be willing to accept anything that you say.\u201d</li></ol><p><br><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Arguments Aren\u2019t Battles.</strong> If your goal is to win, you\u2019ve already lost.
