    "Description": "<p>We interrupt our regular programming for this extremely important message.</p><p>We stand with our black sisters and brothers against the evil that is racism. The recent events of police brutality and oppression against black people have been truly horrifying.</p><p>Please take the time to listen to the audio snippet on the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">#BlackLivesMatter</a> movement from today's episode. It is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-VUOgS3rE\">TedX talk by the far more eloquent Kennedy Cook</a> who's voice and words are more powerful than ours.</p><p>We've never been very vocal about political issues at Fragmented. But that doesn't mean we don't care about these issues. On the contrary! We do our best to have our actions speak louder than our words and let others with first hand experience speak out. Then importantly <strong>we aim to listen</strong>.</p><p>But these aren't regular times are they? The horrifying brutality we're seeing against people of color is nauseating. The Covid-19 outbreak has made action particularly difficult so for today we will start with these words.</p><h3>How to help:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.change.org/t/racial-justice-4\">change.org [racial justice]</a></li></ul>\n",
