    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Ken Jee. Ken's a Data Scientist. He's also a Sports Analytics practitioner who works with US Team Golf and USA Basketball.\u00a0</p> <p>Ken hosts the excellent Ken's Nearest Neighbors podcast and the Exponential Athelete podcast.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How an injury pushed Ken out of pro sports and into data science</p> <p>- How Ken explains his statistical insights to coaches and players to help them improve their performance</p> <p>- Why Ken doesn't think building projects is all that useful anymore. \"Data Scientists should instead build products.\"</p> <p>- How Ken starts and ends each day with meditation, and writes down all the ideas that pop into his head after each session.</p> <p>- Ken's observation that: \"Who is the best suited to excel in a world where AI tools are prominent? Probably the people who are building them. People in the data science domain, people who are coding \u2013 they're the most prepared to use these tools for other things.\"</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 2006 dance song, and it was originally played on a synth.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 10,109 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
