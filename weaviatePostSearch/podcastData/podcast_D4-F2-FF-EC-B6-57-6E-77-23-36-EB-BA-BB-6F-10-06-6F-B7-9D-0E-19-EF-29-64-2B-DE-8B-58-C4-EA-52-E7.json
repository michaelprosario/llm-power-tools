She believes this so much she's launched a whole online course - Newbie Coder Problem Solving School - that teaches tons of problem solving skills...with not a single line of code! Is this possible? A good idea? We find out this week!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lavieencode.net/launchpad\">https://www.lavieencode.net/launchpad</a></li></ul>\n",
