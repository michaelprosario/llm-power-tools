    "Description": "<p>What are the principles you should consider when making decisions about which Python tools to use? What anti-patterns get in the way of making the right choices for your team? Christopher Trudeau is back on the show this week, bringing another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>We discuss a recent article about effective Python developer tooling. Instead of digging into a list of current libraries, we talk about the principles you must consider before making decisions for your team. We cover common pitfalls teams get mired in and how to avoid them.</p>\n<p>We also share several other articles and projects from the Python community, including a news roundup, a huge collection of the top Python libraries of 2024, programming sockets in Python, merging dictionaries, a Django quiz, mistakes to avoid in production, building a Portal sentry turret, a powerful TUI expense tracker, and a pure-Python async rendering engine.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/managing-dependencies-with-poetry/\">Managing Dependencies With Python Poetry</a></p>\n<p>Learn how Python Poetry can help you start new projects, maintain existing ones, and master dependency management.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:01:53 &ndash; DjangoCon US 2025 (Chicago, Sept 8-12) Announced</li>\n<li>00:02:38 &ndash; Textualize 1.0 Released</li>\n<li>00:03:15 &ndash; Top Python Libraries of 2024</li>\n<li>00:07:07 &ndash; Programming Sockets in Python</li>\n<li>00:11:56 &ndash; Merging Dictionaries in Python</li>\n<li>00:17:03 &ndash; Django Quiz 2024</li>\n<li>00:17:55 &ndash; Confessions of a Django Dev: Mistakes To Avoid in Production</li>\n<li>00:18:40 &ndash; Sentry Turret Straight Out of the &lsquo;Portal&rsquo; Franchise</li>\n<li>00:20:00 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:21:26 &ndash; Effective Python Developer Tooling in December 2024</li>\n<li>00:41:13 &ndash; Bagels: Powerful TUI Expense Tracker</li>\n<li>00:43:42 &ndash; htmy: Async, Pure-Python Rendering Engine</li>\n<li>00:45:41 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>News:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.defna.org/announcements/2024/12/31/djangoconus-2025-announced/\">DjangoCon US 2025 (Chicago, Sept 8-12) Announced</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases\">Textualize 1.0 Released</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryolabs.com/blog/top-python-libraries-2024\">Top Python Libraries of 2024</a> &ndash; For the past ten years, Tyrolabs has put together a list of their favorite Python libraries of the year.
