Open-endedness is a class of algorithms which generate problems and solutions to increasingly complex and diverse tasks. These algorithms create their own curriculum of learning. Complex tasks become tractable because they are now the final stepping stone in a lineage of progressions. In many respects, it's better to trust the machine to develop the learning curriculum, because the best curriculum might be counter-intuitive. These algorithms can generate a radiating tree of evolving challenges and solutions just like natural evolution. Evolution has produced an eternity of diversity and complexity and even produced human intelligence as a side-effect! Could AI-generating algorithms be the next big thing in machine learning?</p>\n<p>Wang, Rui, et al. \"Enhanced POET: Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning through Unbounded Invention of Learning Challenges and their Solutions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.08536 (2020). https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08536</p>\n<p>Wang, Rui, et al. \"Paired open-ended trailblazer (poet): Endlessly generating increasingly complex and diverse learning environments and their solutions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.01753 (2019). https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753</p>\n<p>Watch Yannic\u2019s video on POET: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wkgDnNxiVs<br>\nand on the extended POET: https://youtu.be/gbG1X8Xq-T8<br>\nWatch Connor\u2019s video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxIkPxkN10U<br>\nUberAI labs video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX0sKDRq400 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>#reinforcementlearning #machinelearning #uber #deeplearning #rl #timscarfe #connorshorten #yannickilcher</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
