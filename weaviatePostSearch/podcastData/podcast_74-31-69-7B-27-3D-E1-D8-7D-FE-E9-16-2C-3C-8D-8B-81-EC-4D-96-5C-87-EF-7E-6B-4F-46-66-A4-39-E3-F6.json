    "Description": "<p>Where is Exchange 2016 on your radar? Richard chats with Tony Redmond about the current history of Exchange, from 2003 onward. Tony talks about the growth of Exchange Online with Office 365, and the impact that has had on the shape of Exchange on-premise. This leads to a discussion about Exchange 2016 which looks to be a maturing of Exchange 2013 without really disruptive changes. One of the biggest changes in the past three years has been the improvement in updates, to the point where they are boring - but also that there are no perfect versions of software anymore, just an on-going continuum. Lots of digressions, but also great thinking about modern on-premise and in-cloud mail!</p>\n",
