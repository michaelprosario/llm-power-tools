    "Description": "<p>This New Stack Makers podcast co-hosted by TNS founder and publisher, Alex Williams and Joan Westenberg, founder and writer of Joan\u2019s Index, discussed Copilot. Westenberg highlighted its integration with Microsoft 365 and its role as a coding assistant, showcasing its potential to streamline various tasks.\u00a0</p><p>However, she also revealed its limitations, particularly in reliability. Despite being designed to assist with tasks across Microsoft 365, Copilot's performance fell short during Westenberg's tests, failing to retrieve necessary information from her email and Microsoft Teams meetings. While Copilot proves useful for coding, providing helpful code snippets, its effectiveness diminishes for more complex projects. Westenberg's demonstrations underscored both the strengths and weaknesses of Copilot, emphasizing the need for improvement, especially in reliability, to fulfill its promise as a versatile work companion.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Copilot\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-one-ups-google-with-copilot-stack-for-developers/   \"><strong>Microsoft One-ups Google with Copilot Stack for Developers\u00a0</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/copilot-enterprise-introduces-search-and-customized-best-practices/ \"><strong>Copilot Enterprises Introduces Search and Customized Best Practices\u00a0</strong></a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/ \">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
