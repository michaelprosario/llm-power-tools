    "Description": "Developer Rebecca Garcia had always loved computers. At a young age, she went to MIT's two-week computer science camp. She was surrounded by kids who love to build and make, just like her. But at over $1K a week, it wasn't a very accessible way for kids to learn to code. So when she learned about Coder Dojo many years later, an organization that creates free coding workshops for youth, she wanted in. So she started CoderDojo NYC two years ago, and has been helping kids from ages 7-17 learn to code. We talk about the incredible things these kids have been able to accomplish in these workshops, her thoughts on teaching code in public school, and how she found her own way as a self-taught developer to her current role as a developer evangelist at Squarespace.
