First, it was confusing that I need to put my team aside and take my peers as my first priority, but then I became more curious and then I was intrigued by the results and I'm like, 'Oh, this is so powerful. I need to put this in my own organization.' So I started with my directs like, 'Hey, we have studied about this. We did a whole session and walk them through some real examples. That's where it was like, 'Oh, we need to implement this and see it.'\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Monica Bajaj \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a> is trusted by hundreds of tech-led companies across the globe, including Etsy, <a href=\"http://monday.com/\">monday.com</a>, Skyscanner and more to seamlessly orchestrate incident response from start to finish.
