    "Description": "\n        <p>With no strategic plan and very little money, Sukhi Singh figured out a way to sell Indian food at scale across the U.S.\u2014but it took her almost 20 years to do it.&nbsp;In the early 1990's, she&nbsp;shuttered her faltering caf\u00e9 in Oakland, California and enlisted her husband and three children to help her sell&nbsp;bottled curry paste at local stores\u2014and Indian meals at farmers markets.&nbsp;But the real breakthrough came when Sukhi expanded into refrigerated/frozen meals, and landed her chicken tikka masala and samosas in Costco. After growing the family business without a cent of outside investment, Sukhi's Gourmet Indian Food is now one of the biggest Indian food brands in the U.S, with over fifty products available in around 7,000 stores.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
