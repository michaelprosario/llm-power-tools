    "Description": "<p>I met @JennyBuccos back in 2022 at the Future of Education Technology Conference #FETC and at the #OrlandoScienceCenter #stemfest event. I was in awe of the #Stem program she created and produced called @EXPLR_Media that provides videos that make it possible for kids K-12 see careers in Stem and Tech.
