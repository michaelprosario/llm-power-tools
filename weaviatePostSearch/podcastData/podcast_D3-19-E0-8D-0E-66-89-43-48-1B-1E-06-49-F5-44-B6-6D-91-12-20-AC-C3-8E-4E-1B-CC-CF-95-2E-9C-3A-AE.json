    "Description": "<p>Foone Turing is a self-proclaimed \"software necromancer\" not only bringing classics back to life, but also breathing new life and community into older software and hardware. Foone and Scott recently worked with Microsoft to get Microsoft 3D Movie Maker released as Open Source. We'll hear about Foone's plans for 3D Movie Maker going forward, as well as why the community has such strong feelings for this funny 27 year old piece of software!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/foone/3DMMForever\">https://github.com/foone/3DMMForever</a></li></ul>\n",
