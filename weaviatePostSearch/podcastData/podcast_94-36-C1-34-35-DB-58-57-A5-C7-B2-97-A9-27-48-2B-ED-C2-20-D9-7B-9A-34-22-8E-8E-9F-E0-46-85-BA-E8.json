    "Description": "\n        <p>Artificial General Intelligence gets a new definition: This episode introduces Google DeepMind\u2019s paper, \u201cLevels of AGI: Operationalizing Progress on the Path to AGI\u201d. Hear how its authors have organized narrow and general AI into hierarchical categories defined by human capability, from Level 0 (no AI) and Level 1 (equal to or somewhat better than an unskilled human) to Level 5 (able to outperform 100% of humans). A scary thought? Or a vision of a better future? Host Jon Krohn details the strengths of this research in this Five-Minute Friday.<br><br>Additional materials: <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/748\">www.superdatascience.com/748</a><br><br>Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?
