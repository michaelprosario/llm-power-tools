    "Description": "<p>Everyone needs source control! Richard chats with Nicole Stevens about what IT Pros need to know around source control. Normally the purview of developers, source control is useful anywhere you have text that needs to be stored, versioned, and protected. Nicole talks about how you can use GitHub in a private repository to manage your own scripts - keep track of the changes you make over time, be able to go back to old versions, and so on. And when the whole team gets involved, it gets even more interesting!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/\">GitHub Workflow</a></li></ul>\n",
