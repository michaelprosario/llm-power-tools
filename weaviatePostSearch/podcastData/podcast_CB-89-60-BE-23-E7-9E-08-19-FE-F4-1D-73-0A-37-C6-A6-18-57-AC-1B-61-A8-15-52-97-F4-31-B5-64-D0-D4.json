    "Description": "<p>She was named America\u2019s Top Young Scientist of 2017 by the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge, with a patent-pending device to detect lead in water faster than any other current techniques. She then open-sourced this device so people can use the technology across the world. In today's show, Gitanjali talks about her learning journey and the teachers who reached her (and the pedagogies that didn't.) This show is a must-listen for science teachers and teachers everywhere.</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e556\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e556</a></p> <p>Bio As submitted</p> <p>Gitanjali Rao is 13 years old and is an 8th grader at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Highlands Ranch, CO.
