    "Description": "<p>Of course you can scale in the cloud - but exactly how? Richard chats with Corey Sanders who goes on a whirlwind tour of the many options in Azure to help your applications be reliable and scalable. First up is a discussion on Virtual Machines and Scale Sets - rather than making separate VMs for every instance of your application, you can build them in blocks up to a thousand! After discussing the kind of problems that need a thousand of anything, Corey dives into Service Fabric and Containers, getting more fine-grained and lighter weight so that you can scale faster. And it works with existing applications as well, opening the door to moving what you have today to the cloud!</p>\n",
