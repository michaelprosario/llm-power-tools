    "Description": "<p>Leadership wants to get on the AI bandwagon - what are the security risks? While at the Kansas City Developers Conference, Richard sat down with Steve Poole to talk about his experiences helping companies manage the risk of bringing AI into the company. Steve talks about the impact of introducing a new development stack, especially open-source stacks where you aren't sure of the providence of the code - sometimes there's malware in there! The conversation also moves to the various sources of language models and the potential risks. There's an urgency to move quickly on this technology, but don't allow that urgency to shortcut the safety your company will need - you can do this properly!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\">Hugging Face</a></li></ul><p>Recorded June 27, 2024</p>\n",
