    "SourceUrl": null,
    "Description": "<p>Like so many of us, author Johann Hari noticed that the more time he spent looking at screens and switching from device to device, the harder it became for him to concentrate and achieve his goals. After talking to more than 200 doctors, researchers, and neuroscientists around the world, Johann came to a sobering conclusion: the human race is in the middle of an attention crisis. He examines this societal challenge in his new book, Stolen Focus: Why You Can\u2019t Pay Attention and How to Think Deeply Again.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Johann and Guy discuss the factors chipping away at our ability to focus, and what we can do to reclaim our attention. They also talk about flow states \u2013 how we get into them, and why everyone in the business world should be working to achieve them.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out Johann\u2019s book here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3L3wsMC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3L3wsMC</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
