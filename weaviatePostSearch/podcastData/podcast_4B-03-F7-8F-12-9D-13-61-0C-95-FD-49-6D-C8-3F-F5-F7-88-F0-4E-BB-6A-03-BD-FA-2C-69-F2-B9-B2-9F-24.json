    "Description": "<p>Crash-level bugs continue to pose a significant challenge due to the lack of memory safety in programming languages, an issue persisting since the punch card era. This enduring problem, described as \"the Joker to the Batman\" by Anil Dash, VP of developer experience at Fastly, is highlighted in a recent episode of The New Stack Makers. The White House has emphasized memory safety, advocating for the adoption of memory-safe programming languages and better software measurability. The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) noted that languages like C and C++ lack memory safety traits and are prevalent in critical systems. They recommend using memory-safe languages, such as Java, C#, and Rust, to develop secure software. Memory safety is particularly crucial for the US government due to the high stakes, especially in space exploration, where reliability standards are exceptionally stringent. Dash underscores the importance of resilience and predictability in missions that may outlast their creators, necessitating rigorous memory safety practices.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Memory Safety:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/white-house-warns-against-using-memory-unsafe-languages/ \">White House Warns Against Using Memory-Unsafe Languages\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/can-c-be-saved-bjarne-stroustrup-on-ensuring-memory-safety/ \">Can C++ Be Saved?
