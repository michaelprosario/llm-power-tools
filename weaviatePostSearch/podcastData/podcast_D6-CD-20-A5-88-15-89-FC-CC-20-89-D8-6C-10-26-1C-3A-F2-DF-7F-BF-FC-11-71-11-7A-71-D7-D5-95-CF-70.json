Rebecca found out that the company had not provided sufficient agile training for the teams, which ultimately resulted in too much work-in-process, and other anti-patterns. Rebecca discusses her efforts to help the team focus and collaborate better, only to face resistance from the team's manager. She shares a failed attempt to use <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.leansimulations.org/2010/11/penny-game.html\"> the Penny Game to help the team understand flow and collaboration</a>, but this only resulted in conflict.
