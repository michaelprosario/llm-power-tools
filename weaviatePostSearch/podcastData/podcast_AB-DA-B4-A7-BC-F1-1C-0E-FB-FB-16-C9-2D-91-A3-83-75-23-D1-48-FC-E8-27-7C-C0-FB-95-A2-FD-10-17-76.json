    "Description": "<p>How can Security Copilot help you secure your applications? Richard talks to Ari Schorr about assessing application risk with Microsoft Security Copilot - a new feature in preview in Security Copilot that focuses on application roles and entities. Ari talks about the sheer array of resources that applications depend on, and the many security risks that exist in that space - how do you even get started on the problem? Security Copilot helps to sort through potential risks and help a sysadmin focus in on the most significant risks, especially the low-hanging fruit weak authentication and unused resources. The conversation also explores some of the future potential of a tool like this to detect supply chain attacks, find ways to strengthen and simplify applications so their attack surface is smaller. It's a great time to get familiar with these tools!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot\">Microsoft Security Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/03/update-on-microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-blizzard/\">Midnight Blizzard Attack on Microsoft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative\">Secure Future Initiative</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/copilot-security-entra-investigate-risky-apps\">Assess Application Risk with Microsoft Security Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/overview\">Microsoft Sentinel</a></li></ul><p>Recorded February 18, 2025</p>\n",
