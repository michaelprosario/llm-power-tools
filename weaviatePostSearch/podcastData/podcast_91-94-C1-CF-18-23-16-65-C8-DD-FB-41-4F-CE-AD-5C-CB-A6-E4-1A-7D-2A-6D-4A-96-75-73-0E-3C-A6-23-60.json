    "Description": "<p>Who advocates for operations folks in the cloud? While at Ignite in Orlando, Richard sat down with Rick Claus to talk about what it means to be an advocate, and how operations folks think about the cloud. A lot of cloud concepts, like containers, are driven by development - and yet ultimately, it all needs to be deployed, monitored and managed. Rick digs into how operations people are focusing more on those core competencies than any particular technology, and finding there's more to do, more opportunity and more fun to be had in the cloud - what a great thing to advocate for!</p>\n",
