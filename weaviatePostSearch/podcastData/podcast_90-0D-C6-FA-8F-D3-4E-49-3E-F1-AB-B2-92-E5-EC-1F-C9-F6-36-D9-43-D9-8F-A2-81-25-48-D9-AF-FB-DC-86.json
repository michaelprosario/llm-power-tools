    "Description": "<p>Platform engineering \u201cis the art of designing and binding all of the different tech and tools that you have inside of an organization into a golden path that enables self service for developers and reduces cognitive load,\u201d said Kaspar Von Gr\u00fcnberg, founder and CEO of Humanitec, in this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast.</p><p>This structure is important for individual contributors, Gr\u00fcnberg said, as well as backend engineers: \u201cif you look at the operation teams, it reduces their burden to do repetitive things. And so platform engineers build and design internal developer platforms, and help and serve users.\"</p><p>This conversation, hosted by Heather Joslyn, TNS features editor, dove into platform engineering: what it is, how it works, the problems it is intended to solve, and how to get started in building a platform engineering operation in your organization. It also debunks some key fallacies around the concept.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Platform Engineering and Humanitec:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/\">Platform Engineering Overview, News, and Trends</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-hype-train-is-over-platform-engineering-is-here-to-stay/\">The Hype Train Is Over.
