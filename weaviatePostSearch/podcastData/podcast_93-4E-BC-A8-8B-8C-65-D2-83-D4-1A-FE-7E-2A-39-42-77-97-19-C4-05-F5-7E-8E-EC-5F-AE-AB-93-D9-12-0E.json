    "Description": "<p>When engineer and author Sameer Doshi interviewed remotely for his current job at Microsoft, he was nervous about only one thing: Telling his future employer that he\u2019s blind. He was offered the position, and even after starting he didn\u2019t mention that he\u2019s blind until he needed to put in a request for the special software that helps him do his job. Four years later, he has moved up the ranks to a management position and is thriving. He talks to Scott about tech accommodation, and his new sci-fi book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Work-Ahead-Novel-Sameer-Chopra/dp/B0B1JNGXJJ/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\">The Work Ahead</a>!</p>\n",
