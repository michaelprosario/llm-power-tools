    "Description": "<p>Serial entrepreneur and U.S. National Bobsled Team qualifier Marc Lore joins Guy on the Advice Line, where they answer questions from three early stage founders. Marc also discusses his latest venture - Wonder - and its recent shift away from food prep and delivery vans; plus, what founders should consider when making their own strategic pivots.&nbsp;</p><p>First we meet Ben in Oregon, who\u2019s wondering if his chocolate factory should double down on an experiential offering in light of increased cocoa prices. Then Lindsey in Utah, who\u2019s looking for ways to convince retailers to carry her portable diaper kits. And Ryan in Colorado, who\u2019s weighing whether to focus on national expansion for his whiskey brand, or deepening market penetration in the Rockies.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to the founders of Chomp Chocolate, Baby a GoGo and 10th Mountain Whiskey and Spirit Company for being part of the show.</p><p><br></p><p>If you\u2019d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you\u2019d like answered.
