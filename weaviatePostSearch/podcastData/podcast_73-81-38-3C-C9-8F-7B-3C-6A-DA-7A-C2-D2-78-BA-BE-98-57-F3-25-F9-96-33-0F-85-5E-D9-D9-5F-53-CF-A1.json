    "Description": "<p>In the coming decades, the technology that enables virtual and augmented reality will improve beyond recognition. Within a century, world-renowned philosopher David J. Chalmers predicts, we will have virtual worlds that are impossible to distinguish from non-virtual worlds. But is virtual reality just escapism?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In a highly original work of &#39;technophilosophy&#39;, Chalmers argues categorically, no: virtual reality is genuine reality. Virtual worlds are not second-class worlds. We can live a meaningful life in virtual reality - and increasingly, we will.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>What is reality, anyway? How can we lead a good life? Is there a god? How do we know there&#39;s an external world - and how do we know we&#39;re not living in a computer simulation? In Reality+, Chalmers conducts a grand tour of philosophy, using cutting-edge technology to provide invigorating new answers to age-old questions.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>David J. Chalmers is an Australian philosopher and cognitive scientist specializing in the areas of philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. He is Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science at New York University, as well as co-director of NYU&#39;s Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness. Chalmers is best known for his work on consciousness, including his formulation of the &quot;hard problem of consciousness.&quot;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy</p>\n<p>https://amzn.to/3RYyGD2</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>https://consc.net/</p>\n<p>https://x.com/davidchalmers42</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:00 Reality+ Intro</p>\n<p>00:12:02 GPT conscious? 10/10</p>\n<p>00:14:19 The consciousness processor thought experiment (11/10)</p>\n<p>00:20:34 Intelligence and Consciousness entangled? 10/10</p>\n<p>00:22:44 Karl Friston / Meta Problem 10/10</p>\n<p>00:29:05 Knowledge argument / subjective experience (6/10)</p>\n<p>00:32:34 Emergence 11/10 (best chapter)</p>\n<p>00:42:45 Working with Douglas Hofstadter 10/10</p>\n<p>00:46:14 Intelligence is analogy making? 10/10</p>\n<p>00:50:47 Intelligence explosion 8/10</p>\n<p>00:58:44 Hypercomputation 10/10</p>\n<p>01:09:44 Who designed the designer?
