    "Description": "<p>Charlie Jones, Director of Product Management at ReversingLabs and subject matter expert in supply chain security, joins host <a href= \"../../../team/priyanka-raghavan/\">Priyanka Raghavan</a> to discuss tackling third-party software risks. They begin by defining different types of third-party software risks and then take a deep dive into case studies where third-party components and software have had cascading effects on downstream systems. They consider some frameworks for secure software development that can be used to evaluate third-party software and components \u2013 both as a publisher or as a consumer \u2013 and end by discussing laws and regulations with final advise from Charlie on how enterprises can tackle third-party software risks.
