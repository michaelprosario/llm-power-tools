    "Description": "\n        <p>Most people don't follow through on the goals that they set for themselves. This is common knowledge. But the more important question is: <em>Why</em> are people struggling to achieve their goals? It turns out that some of it has to do with <em>how</em> we structure our goals and some of it has to do with our motivation for choosing those goals in the first place.</p><p>In this episode, Megan and Michael talk about five mistakes that people make when setting goals and how to move forward. Then, Joel speaks to author Luke Burgis about the importance of <em>how</em> we're motivated.</p><p>Make sure to check out Luke's book, <a href=\"https://lukeburgis.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life</em></a>.</p><p>If you need help setting your goals, then you should check out Full Focus' Best Year Ever event on January 6, 2023.
