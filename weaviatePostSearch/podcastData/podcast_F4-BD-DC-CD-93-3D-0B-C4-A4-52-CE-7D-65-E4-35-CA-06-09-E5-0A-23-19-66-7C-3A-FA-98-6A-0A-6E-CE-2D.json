I am teaching technology education for the first time this year after five years of teaching in elementary classrooms. Technology and education are my passion and I\u2019m beyond excited to be starting my career as a technology education teacher. I am also a coach to a first-year team of sixth and seventh graders with the Odyssey of the Mind program. I have so much to learn and I look forward to all the challenges and exciting moments ahead!  Outside of school, I\u2019m a mom to an incredible little girl and wife to my loving husband. My husband, Casey, is an engineer and loves to get involved in the projects I\u2019m doing with my students. Together, with my mom, our family is working to re-establish the farm that\u2019s been in my family for generations. There are so many great things to look forward to in life and we all strive to do what we love in life.</p>",
