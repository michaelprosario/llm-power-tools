    "Description": "\n        <p>After accidentally starting a business (tune in for the whole story!) as a college undergrad, <a href=\"http://studentmaid.com\">Student Maid</a> founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.kristenhadeed.com/book/\">Kristen Hadeed</a> has learned a lot about leadership from her mistakes along the way\u2014and you can too. But one of the most important things she\u2019s learned is that no matter what business you\u2019re in, everyone wants the same thing: to feel valued. To that end, she has become passionate about not only growing herself as a leader but also helping her team do the same. Her company may be in the cleaning business, but she likes to say she\u2019s in the business of making her team members better people. You can do the same thing in your own business and if you ask Kristen, the upside is endless. Join us to learn how it\u2019s done.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/sms-opt-in-elvalues\">How To Create Core Values</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://learn.infusionsoft.com/resources/guides/how-to-achieve-worklife-balance?PartnerId=001j000000YDIsB&amp;AffiliateCode=a60166&amp;CampaignId=701j0000001mlwy&amp;TrackingLinkId=a1Bf10000036Sqp&amp;Link_Posted_By__c=005j000000DNBat&amp;ls=strat-bizdev_general_podcast~EntreLeadershipPodcast_WorkLife~2017-08-11__&amp;utm_source=general&amp;utm_medium=strat-bizdev&amp;utm_campaign=podcast~EntreLeadershipPodcast_WorkLife~2017-08-11__\"> How To Achieve Work/Life Balance</a></p>\n      ",
