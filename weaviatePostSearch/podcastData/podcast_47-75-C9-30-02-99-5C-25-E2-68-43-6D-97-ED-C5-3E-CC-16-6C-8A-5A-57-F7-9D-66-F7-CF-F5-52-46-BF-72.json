    "Description": "<p>I met Diana Teel at the Central Florida Tech Grove when they hosted Indienomicon\u2019s Armed Forces Game Jam. She is smart, personable, and someone you want to have on your side. Why? Because she is all five of these words that she shared that describe her.</p>\n<p>1. Tenacious -both of her parents were marines and she learned as a young child not to give up, especially if the answer was no - it would likely turn into a yes later. \u00a0<br>\n2. Passionate - she cares about others and the work she does.<br>\n3. Curious - so much going on in the world and she realizes she asks \u201cwhy,\u201d similar to how a child questions to understand.<br>\n4. Connector - Diana loves connecting people to others that creates opportunities to get energy flowing that makes magic happen.<br>\n5. Holistic - Diana is a breast cancer survivor and that changed her perspective on life. She chose to look at her life and improve in all areas. Nutrition, faith, physical movement, being supportive of others and allowing herself to be supported.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diana is a driven technologist that wears multiple hats. Let\u2019s count them</p>\n<p>1. Director of the NavalX Central Florida Tech Bridge,\u00a0<br>\n2. Outreach Director/Chief Evangelist with the Naval Air Warfare Center<br>\n3. Director with Team Orlando and\u00a0<br>\n4. Central Florida Tech Grove</p>\n<p>Tune in to hear her favorite thought leaders from Marcus Aurelius (yes the Roman emperor) favorite quotes to Elon Musk and what she learned from listening to his audiobook. We dove into the Gen AI discussions and Diana\u2019s mentoring advice for our listeners.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Intern Whisperer Podcast is brought to you by Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
