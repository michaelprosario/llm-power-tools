    "Description": "<p>In the past year, developers have faced both promise and uncertainty, particularly in the realm of generative AI. Heath Newburn, global field CTO for PagerDuty, joins TNS host Heather Joslyn to talk about the impact AI and other topics will have on developers in 2024.</p><p>Newburn anticipates a growing emphasis on DevSecOps in response to high-profile cyber incidents, noting a shift in executive attitudes toward security spending. The rise of automation-centric tools like Backstage signals a changing landscape in the link between development and operations tools. Notably, there's a move from focusing on efficiency gains to achieving new outcomes, with organizations seeking innovative products rather than marginal coding speed improvements.</p><p>Newburn highlights the importance of experimentation, encouraging organizations to identify areas for trial and error, learning swiftly from failures. The upcoming year is predicted to favor organizations capable of rapid experimentation and information gathering over perfection in code writing.</p><p>Listen to the full podcast episode as Newburn further discusses his predictions related to platform engineering, remote work, and the continued impact of generative AI.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about PagerDuty and trends in software development:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-and-automation-can-improve-operational-resiliency/\">How AI and Automation Can Improve Operational Resiliency</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/why-infrastructure-as-code-is-vital-for-modern-devops/\">Why Infrastructure as Code Is Vital for Modern DevOps</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/operationalizing-ai-accelerating-automation-dataops-aiops/\">Operationalizing AI: Accelerating Automation, DataOps, AIOps</a></p>\n",
