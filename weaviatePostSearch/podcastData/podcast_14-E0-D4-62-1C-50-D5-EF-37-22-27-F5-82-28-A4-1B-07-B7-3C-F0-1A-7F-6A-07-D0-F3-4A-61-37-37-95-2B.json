His goal is to make himself redundant by helping the team become self-sufficient. Hassan emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships with team members, understanding their passions, and continually checking in to ensure personal growth. His ultimate measure of success is when team members grow into leadership roles themselves.</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Simple, Contextual Retrospectives <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Hassan recommends using retrospective formats that suit the team's current context and culture. He highlights the value of keeping things simple when facilitating retrospectives, especially for teams from diverse backgrounds. Early in his career, he realized that fancy formats did not always work, but simple, straightforward retrospectives often led to the most productive conversations. Hassan reminds us that it's not about the format but about what the team needs in the moment.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
