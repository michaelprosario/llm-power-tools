    "Description": "\n        <p>We are so excited to share some of the highlights from last Friday\u2019s EntreLeadership 1-Day event! Over 1,000 small-business owners and leaders from around the country gathered in Nashville to learn all about building a championship team, and it was a power-packed day to say the least. Join us as Dave explains why your team is your absolute most valuable resource\u2014and if it\u2019s not, why it needs to be. He, along with best-selling author and leadership guru Patrick Lencioni, will also break down what might be sabotaging your company\u2019s culture\u2014and exactly how to turn things around for good. And we\u2019ll hear from some of this year\u2019s attendees as they share the personal challenges they\u2019ve faced while running their own businesses. Head\u2019s up: You\u2019ll want to take some notes during this one!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/sms-opt-in-communication\">Team Communication Field Guide</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/allaccess-33444-podcast\">All Access Membership Discount</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://pages.infusionsoft.com/entreleadership_culture_ebook.html\">How to Hire, Engage &amp; Stop Work Stress</a></p>\n      ",
