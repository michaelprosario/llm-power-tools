    "Description": "<p>In this episode, Matt Butcher, CEO of Fermyon Technologies, discusses the potential impact of the component model on WebAssembly (Wasm) and its integration into the cloud-native landscape. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format enabling code to run anywhere, written in developers' preferred languages. The component model aims to provide a common way for WebAssembly libraries to express their needs and connect with other modules, reducing the barriers and maintenance of existing libraries. Butcher believes this model could be a game changer, allowing new languages to compile WebAssembly and utilize existing libraries seamlessly.</p><p>WebAssembly also shows promise in delivering on the long-awaited potential of serverless computing. Unlike traditional virtual machines and containers, WebAssembly boasts a rapid startup time and addresses various developer challenges. Butcher states that developers have been eagerly waiting for a platform with these characteristics, hinting at a potential resurgence of serverless. He clarifies that WebAssembly is not a \"Kubernetes killer\" but can coexist with container technologies, evident from the Kubernetes ecosystem's interest in supporting WebAssembly.</p><p>The episode explores further developments in WebAssembly and its potential to play a central role in the cloud-native ecosystem.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about WebAssembly and Fermyon Technologies:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/webassembly/\">WebAssembly Overview, News, and Trends</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/webassembly/yes-webassembly-can-replace-kubernetes/\">WebAssembly vs. Kubernetes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/fermyon-cloud-save-your-webassembly-serverless-data-locally/\">Fermyon Cloud: Save Your WebAssembly Serverless Data Locally</a></p>\n",
