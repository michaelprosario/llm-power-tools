Dan shares pivotal lessons from his career, from building scalable automation systems to navigating complex leadership challenges. We cover key strategies for aligning tech initiatives with business goals, fostering collaboration, and ensuring long-term technical health.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Defining Leadership Through Automation and Empowerment <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cEnable your humans to focus on the interesting work\u2014automation should take care of the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Dan recounts his transformative experience at CCP Games, makers of EVE Online, where a robust test automation system changed his perspective on scaling technical processes. This role introduced him to the power of automation in freeing up engineers to focus on more exploratory and impactful tasks. He emphasizes how empowering self-directed teams with high-level vision statements enables creativity and innovation.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Building Self-Correcting Processes <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cAlways retro your processes\u2014don\u2019t let them run on autopilot.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Dan explains the importance of self-correcting processes, using the SEV (Side Event) system as an example. He highlights how retrospectives can improve response times and prevent future crises. For Dan, consistent reviews are the key to maintaining agile, resilient systems that adapt to evolving needs.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Bridging the Gap Between Business and Tech <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cThere are no enemies\u2014treat your colleagues like allies working toward a common goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  In cross-functional environments, Dan\u2019s mantra is to focus on the project and maintain open communication. Drawing from his experience in gaming, where multiple departments collaborate on creative projects, he underscores the importance of empathy and curiosity. Asking questions and breaking down solutions into smaller, reviewable pieces can diffuse conflict and build trust.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Future-Proofing Through Strategic Roadmapping <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cThe lifespan of the solution dictates the scope of the work.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Dan shares his approach to strategic roadmapping by considering the expected longevity of technical solutions. He gives an example of building a feature flag system for a game studio that needed to support a long-term vision while adapting to a new game engine. His advice: break large goals into smaller, adaptable increments that align with future changes.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Navigating Leadership Challenges During Organizational Change <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cTrust is your greatest currency during periods of uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Dan reflects on a particularly challenging period when a leadership change caused a significant exodus of engineers at his company, leaving him with only one engineer.
