    "Description": "\n        <p>When Miguel McKelvey was first featured on How I Built This in 2017, his company was growing at an astounding rate. WeWork was considered the unicorn of unicorns. But after reaching a $47 billion valuation in 2019, WeWork\u2019s tide began to turn. Investors raised concerns about the company\u2019s rapid expansion and unsustainable spending. Miguel\u2019s co-founder Adam Neuman faced accusations of mismanagement and was forced to resign. The company withdrew a long-anticipated IPO filing, and not long after, Miguel left the company he had worked so hard to build.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, the cautionary tale of WeWork has become a bit of a cultural obsession, retold on podcasts, a Hulu documentary, and even an Apple TV series this year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Miguel McKelvey returns to reflect on his experience at WeWork, the lessons he\u2019s learned, and what he\u2019s working on now.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to Miguel\u2019s original How I Built This episode: <a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-wework-miguel-mckelvey/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-wework-miguel-mckelvey/</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Listen to the WeCrashed podcast from Wondery: <a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
