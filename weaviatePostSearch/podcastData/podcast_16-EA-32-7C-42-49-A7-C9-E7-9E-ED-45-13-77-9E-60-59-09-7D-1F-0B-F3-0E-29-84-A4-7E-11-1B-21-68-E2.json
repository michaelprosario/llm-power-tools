    "Description": "<p>After the XZ Utils backdoor vulnerability was uncovered in March, the OpenJS Foundation saw a surge in inquiries from potential open source JavaScript contributors. Robin Ginn, executive director of the foundation, noted that volunteer-led JavaScript communities often face challenges in managing these contributions. The discovery that a single contributor, \"Jia Tan,\" planted the backdoor heightened vigilance, especially when new contributors requested admin privileges. Ginn emphasized that trust is not synonymous with security, especially in open source projects where maintainers must be vigilant about who can access their repositories.</p><p>The XZ vulnerability highlighted broader concerns about the security of open source software, particularly in projects with only a single maintainer. Despite receiving a significant grant from Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund, the foundation remains under-resourced, with just two full-time staffers supporting 35 projects. Ginn urged companies that rely on open source software to invest in it by hiring maintainers, ensuring these critical projects are properly supported.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about open source vulnerability</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/linux-xz-backdoor-damage-could-be-greater-than-feared/\">Linux xz Backdoor Damage Could Be Greater Than Feared</a>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/unzipping-the-xz-backdoor-and-its-lessons-for-open-source/\">Unzipping the XZ Backdoor and Its Lessons for Open Source\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/linux-xz-and-the-great-flaws-in-open-source/\">Linux xz and the Great Flaws in Open Source\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a>\u00a0</p><h1>\u00a0</h1>\n",
