    "Description": "<p>Starting a business with your spouse can either bring you closer together or tear you apart. For Arran and Ratana Stephens, their business has lasted for nearly 40 years, and their marriage has thrived for much longer.&nbsp;As business partners, they seem perfectly matched: he\u2019s the hard-charging visionary, she\u2019s the practical, business-minded one who sometimes has to talk him out of a bad decision.&nbsp;But in 1985, Arran made a very smart move: seeing how organic food was starting to take off, he mixed up his first batch of Manna bread in a bathtub and started selling it, eventually expanding to national distribution.&nbsp;From there, he and Ratana pivoted to breakfast cereal,&nbsp;initially purchasing a factory that couldn\u2019t make a single cornflake.&nbsp;Today, Nature\u2019s Path sells organic cereals, tortilla chips and other snacks in more than 50 countries around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
