    "Description": "<p>In 2014, friends Polina Veksler and Alex Waldman went clothes shopping at a major department store. To Polina\u2019s surprise, Alex\u2019s options were quite limited, and tucked away in one of the store\u2019s less-traveled upper levels: the \u2018plus-size\u2019 section.&nbsp;</p><p>This unnerving realization that women could have such completely different shopping experiences at the same store drove Polina into research mode. She found that about 70% of women in the U.S. wear a size 14 or larger, but less than 20% of clothing is made in those sizes. Meanwhile, much of the double-digit-sized clothing available is fast fashion: not particularly well-fitting or built to last.</p><p>Alex and Polina decided to create Universal Standard: a clothing brand where size was irrelevant \u2013 where any woman could shop and ask herself, \u201cdo I like this?\u201d \u2013 not \u201cdoes this come in my size?\u201d</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Guy and Polina discuss the $100 billion opportunity to serve women of all sizes, as well as the challenges that come with building a size inclusive clothing brand.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
