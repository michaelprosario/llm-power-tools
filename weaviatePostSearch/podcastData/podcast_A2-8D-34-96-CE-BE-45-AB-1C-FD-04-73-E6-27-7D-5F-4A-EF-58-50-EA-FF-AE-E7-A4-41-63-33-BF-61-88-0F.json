    "Description": "<p>How can artificial intelligence help sysadmins? While at Ignite in Seattle, Richard talked with Gil Pekelman of Atera about their AI for IT product. Gil talks about developing smart instrumentation for IT and extensively monitoring machines and networks to give you a broad overview of your infrastructure. Then OpenAI expanded its capabilities - allowing users to submit report requests to a large language model that can act as a copilot or an autopilot, able to resolve tickets or prepare them for a sysadmin to act quickly. </p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.atera.com/\">Atera</a></li><li><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service\">Azure OpenAI Service</a></li></ul><p>Recorded November 16, 2023</p>\n",
