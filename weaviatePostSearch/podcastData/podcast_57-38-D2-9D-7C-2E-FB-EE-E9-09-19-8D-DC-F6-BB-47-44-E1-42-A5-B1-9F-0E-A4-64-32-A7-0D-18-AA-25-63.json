Additionally, we discuss the importance of expertise in supervising AI, the role of AI in formative assessment, and how to protect student privacy if you're using a public AI tool. As we discuss new tools, we must be realistic about tools that may go away at some point, as many did during Web 2.0. So, Monica shares insights on preparing for the potential discontinuation of EdTech tools and highlights the significance of transferable skills.\u00a0 As we finish, we discuss two of Monica's favorite AI-powered educational tools, including Diffit and Brisk Teaching.</p> <p>Sponsor: EVERFI from Blackbaud</p> <p>Do you want to equip your students for success in both their careers and personal lives, but find yourself racing against the clock?
