    "Description": "<p>KubeCon 2023 is set to feature three hot topics, according to Taylor Dolezal from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Firstly, GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking the spotlight, particularly regarding their security and integration with legacy infrastructure. Platform engineering is also on the rise, with over 25 sessions at KubeCon Chicago focusing on its definition and how it benefits internal product teams by fostering a culture of product proliferation. Lastly, WebAssembly is emerging as a significant topic, with a dedicated day during the conference week. It is maturing and finding its place, potentially complementing containers, especially in edge computing scenarios. Wasm allows for efficient data processing before data reaches the cloud, adding depth to architectural possibilities.</p><p>Overall, these three trends are expected to dominate discussions and presentations at KubeCon NA 2023, offering insights into the future of cloud-native technology.</p><p>See what came out of the last KubeCon event in Amsterdam earlier this year:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/ai-talk-at-kubecon/\" target=\"_blank\">AI Talk at KubeCon</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/dont-force-containers-and-disrupt-workflows/\" target=\"_blank\">Don\u2019t Force Containers and Disrupt Workflows</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/a-boring-kubernetes-release/\" target=\"_blank\">A Boring Kubernetes Release</a></p>\n",
