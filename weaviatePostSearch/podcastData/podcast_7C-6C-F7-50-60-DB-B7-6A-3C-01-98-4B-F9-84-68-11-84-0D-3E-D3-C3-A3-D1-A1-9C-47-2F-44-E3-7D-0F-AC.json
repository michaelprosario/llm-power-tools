    "Description": "<p>This week we had a super insightful conversation with &nbsp;Jordan Edwards, Principal Program Manager for the AzureML team! &nbsp;Jordan is on the coalface of turning machine learning software engineering into a reality for some of Microsoft's largest customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ML DevOps is all about increasing the velocity of- and orchastrating the non-interactive phase of- software deployments for ML. We cover ML DevOps and Microsoft Azure ML. We discuss model governance, testing, intepretability, tooling. We cover the age-old discussion of the dichotomy between science and engineering and how you can bridge the gap with ML DevOps. We cover Jordan's maturity model for ML DevOps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also cover off some of the exciting ML announcments from the recent Microsoft Build conference i.e. FairLearn, IntepretML, SEAL, WhiteNoise, OpenAI code generation, OpenAI GPT-3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:00:04 Introduction to ML DevOps and Microsoft Build ML Announcements</p>\n<p>00:10:29 Main show kick-off</p>\n<p>00:11:06 Jordan's story</p>\n<p>00:14:36 Typical ML DevOps workflow</p>\n<p>00:17:38 Tim's articulation of ML DevOps</p>\n<p>00:19:31 Intepretability / Fairness</p>\n<p>00:24:31 Testing / Robustness</p>\n<p>00:28:10 Using GANs to generate testing data</p>\n<p>00:30:26 Gratuitous DL?</p>\n<p>00:33:46 Challenges of making an ML DevOps framework / IaaS</p>\n<p>00:38:48 Cultural battles in ML DevOps</p>\n<p>00:43:04 Maturity Model for Ml DevOps</p>\n<p>00:49:19 ML: High interest credit card of technical debt paper</p>\n<p>00:50:19 ML Engineering at Microsoft</p>\n<p>01:01:20 ML Flow</p>\n<p>01:03:05 Company-wide governance&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:08:15 What's coming next</p>\n<p>01:12:10 Jordan's hillarious piece of advice for his younger self</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Super happy with how this turned out, this is not one to miss folks!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>#deeplearning #machinelearning #devops #mldevops</p>\n",
