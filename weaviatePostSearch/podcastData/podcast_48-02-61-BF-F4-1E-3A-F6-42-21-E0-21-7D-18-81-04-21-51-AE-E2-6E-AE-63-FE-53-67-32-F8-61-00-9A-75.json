    "Description": "<p>Ready to put your PBX in the cloud? Richard chats with Tom Arbuthnot about the Cloud PBX offering as part of Office 365 Skype for Business. Skype for Business has been around for awhile, as part of an overall cloud-based unified communication strategy - so what makes the Cloud PBX offering unique? Tom talks about how Microsoft is talking on the PSTN services as well - in the United States (at least for now), they've become a full-fledged carrier and can sell you PSTN numbers that bridge into Office 365. Elsewhere in the world you can work with your local carrier to provide SIP and TDM access up to Office 365 and get pretty much the same result. If you're looking to update your PBX, you need to check this out!</p>\n",
