Arun discusses expanding the product line beyond analytics to include real-time intelligence and hosting primary data workloads. The goal is to make it incredibly easy to get your organization's \"data estate in order\"... not just for security and analytics, but also for your upcoming AI-related workloads. Arun also discusses the power of conversational interfaces to access data, helping leaders get answers quickly and allowing analysts in your organization to build resources that can answer those questions quickly.</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric\">Microsoft Fabric</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 20, 2025</p>\n",
