    "SourceUrl": "https://fragmentedpodcast.com/",
    "Description": "<p>In this episode Donn and Kaushik talk about frustration, finding \"flow state\" and how it's known as \"the madness\" and how to deal with it.</p><p>We originally were going to talk about an other topic, but during the off air banter Donn brought up how he was frustrated with losing/burning so much time on a task that he had for his side project. He only meant to spend a little bit of time on it and then spent WAY more time than he meant to. He got to the point where he had to stop working on the project, yell at himself for not time boxing it and then he had to refocus. This piqued Kaushik's interest and they decided to hit record to talk about this topic as its something they both deal with and have also hear many other developers deal with too.\u00a0</p><p>The \"Madness\" is when you get consumed by your work and you're so passionate that you lose track of time, eating and more. You've become consumed ... you have \"The Madness\". This happens to all developers, and Donn and Kaushik talk about how to not let this derail your day when you have other responsibilities as well as life and work. We hope you enjoy today's off the cuff developer discussion.</p><h2>Donn's Git Course</h2><p>Need to learn Git? Donn has the course for you.
