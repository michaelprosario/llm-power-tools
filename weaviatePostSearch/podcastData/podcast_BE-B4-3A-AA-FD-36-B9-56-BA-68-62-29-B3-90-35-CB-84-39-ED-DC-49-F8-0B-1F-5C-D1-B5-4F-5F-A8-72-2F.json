    "Description": "  Richard Brenner: How Small Signs of Cynicism Can Destroy Agile Team Cohesion <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Richard shares a powerful story about how team dysfunction often starts with small steps. During a joint retrospective with three agile teams, Richard witnessed a moment where a team member made a cynical comment toward a manager who was attempting to participate. This revealed a damaged relationship between management and the team, creating tension that Richard initially chose to ignore. Looking back, he would now immediately address such comments and tackle the \"elephant in the room.\" Richard explains how seemingly minor behaviors like cynicism or passive-destructive actions (such as consistently being late to stand-ups) can significantly impact team health. He recommends establishing conflict resolution protocols early and using impact feedback without judgment to address these issues before they escalate.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://jcalvopascua.medium.com/navigating-the-five-levels-of-conflict-9d7958ef09c8\">  Lysa Adkins\u2019 conflict resolution protocol</a>.\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  What small signs of dysfunction might you be overlooking in your team that could develop into larger problems?</p>   Featured Book of the Week: Solution Focused Coaching for Agile Teams <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Richard recommends <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4chbwAH\"> \"Solution Focused Coaching for Agile Teams\" by Ralph and Veronika</a>.
