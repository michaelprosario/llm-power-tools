    "SourceUrl": "https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/self-taught-programmer",
    "Description": "Courteney Ervin taught herself to code. She did it in her spare time, finding hours late at night and on weekends to grow her skills. And in that time, she went to her first hackathon, made her first open source contribution, taught others to code, and finally found herself in a full-time role as a developer. She tells us about her journey, and the key moments that helped her advance her tech career, and shares advice on how others can make the most of their self-taught journey.
