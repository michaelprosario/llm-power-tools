    "Description": "\n        To build a winning company, you need a winning team. A-players can skyrocket your success, and nothing will tank momentum faster than adding a B- or C-level player to the mix. We all seem to know that at some level. But when it\u2019s time to hire, we always seem to be in a hurry. We feel some unstated urgency to keep the seats filled and the machine running. That almost always leads to a bad hire, as we\u2019ve learned the hard way! But there is a way to make recruiting easier, and we\u2019ll tell you about it on today\u2019s episode. We really like this episode because it\u2019s a chance to showcase some of the initiatives we\u2019ve created around recruiting and retention. More than that, it\u2019s a subject we\u2019re really passionate about. We love our team, and we believe they are the secret to our success. After listening to this episode, we hope you\u2019ll agree that your people truly are your number-one asset. And? You\u2019ll have the insight you need to begin gathering a top team of your own. \u00a0 If you\u2019re ready to get off the turnover treadmill and start attracting and keeping high performers, this episode is for you.
