    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Angie Jones. She's a developer and holder of 27 software patents. She's worked at companies like IBM and Twitter, doing both test engineering and developer advocacy.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How a bad performance review from her boss early in her career taught her to be less timid and more vocal about her ideas.</p> <p>- How she invented lots of software testing processes and holds 27 software patents.</p> <p>- Her work at IBM, Twitter, and other big tech companies.</p> <p>- How feature development and test development are completely different disciplines, which each require dedicated practice and their own mindsets</p> <p>- Her interest in the game Second Life and the possibility of virtual worlds</p> <p>- How she uses AI for debugging and test engineering</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 1992 Acid Jazz song.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 9,779 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
