    "Description": "<p>Scott talks with Joe Karlsson about Document Databases like MongoDB and how they differ from classic Table-based (ER) databases. Can this next generation of WebAPI and JSON-powered cloud DB allow more beginners to get into programming? Is this the death of select * from table?</p><p>NOTE: Scott met Joe while speaking at Codeland. While Mongo is a sponsor of Hanselminutes, this interview isn't related to that sponsorship in any way. Hanselminutes doesn't do \"sponsored guests,\" only awesome guests.</p>\n",
