    "Description": "<p>Asif Makhani, CTO @ Handshake shares about making non-incremental career transitions, unique opportunities at startups, and exercising influence at mid-stage companies. Plus Asif shares questions to help you gain clarity before your next transitions AND how to attract & retain senior engineers at smaller companies.</p><p><i>\"When you have the ability to take a step back, you begin to think a little bit more philosophically about your journey. And it's not just incremental thinking. When it's incremental thinking it's about, 'what's next in my career.'</i></p><p><i>But when you are able to take a step back, it's about... 'What impact do you want to leave behind? When I look back 10 years from now, will I be happy? Will I feel a sense of fulfillment?'</i></p><p><i>I think that line of questioning really gives you the courage to be able to break away from an incremental way of looking at next steps.\"</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>ABOUT ASIF MAKHANI</strong></p><p>Asif has over 20 years of engineering experience with a focus on search engines and edtech.
