    "Description": "<p>Martin Casado and Sonal Chokshi explore what makes a great VP of Engineering at startups! You\u2019ll hear how successful VPEs are evaluated, the ideal experience and success criteria. You\u2019ll hear rapid-fire responses covering how to scale yourself, KPIs, the ideal VPE hiring time for startups, and what VPEs should definitely NOT do.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>MARTIN CASADO, GENERAL PARTNER @ ANDREESSEN HOROWITZ</strong></p><p>He was previously cofounder and CTOr at Nicira (acquired by VMware for $1.26 billion). At VMware, Martin was SVP & GM of the Networking and Security Business Unit (which he scaled to a $600 million run-rate). Martin\u2019s early career was at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory working on large-scale simulations for the Department of Defense, networking, and cybersecurity.</p><p>He holds both a PhD and Masters degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, where he created the software-defined networking (SDN) movement and cofounded Illuminics Systems (acquired by Quova). He\u2019s been awarded both the ACM Grace Murray Hopper award and the NEC C&C award, and he\u2019s an inductee of the Lawrence Livermore Lab\u2019s Entrepreneur\u2019s Hall of Fame. Martin serves on the board of: ActionIQ, Astranis, DeepMap, Imply, Kong, Pindrop Security, RapidAPI, SigOpt, and Yubico.</p><p><i>\u201cIn my experience over a number of engineering leaders is whether or not they're a good engineer is totally orthogonal to the actual role. And in fact, someone that's deeply passionate about a particular architecture technology or approach can be very damaging because you have a power asymmetry in the team.\u201d</i> - Martin Casado</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>SONAL CHOKSHI, EDITOR IN CHIEF @ ANDREESSEN HOROWITZ AKA \"a16z\"</strong></p><p>Sonal built and oversees all of Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s editorial operations, including showrunning and hosting the a16z Podcast, leading production of the a16z Crypto Canon; and more.
