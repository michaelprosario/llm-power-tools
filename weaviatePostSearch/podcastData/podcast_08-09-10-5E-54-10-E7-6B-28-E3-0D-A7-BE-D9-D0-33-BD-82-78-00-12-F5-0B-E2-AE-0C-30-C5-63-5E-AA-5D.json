    "Description": "<p>In this Part 2 on tiny Game Development, we talked to Dylan Bennett from the Portland Indie Game Squad (PIG Squad). He's made a great 72-page zine about doing game development with PICO-8. The zine assumes you have never done game development before. However, there are sections specifically for people who have done game development before, but would like to do so in PICO-8.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-pico-8-issue1\">https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-pico-8-issue1</a></li></ul>\n",
