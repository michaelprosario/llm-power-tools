    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Elliot Arledge. He's a 20-year old computer science student who's created several popular freeCodeCamp courses on LLMs, the Mojo programming language, and GPU programming with CUDA. He joins us from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p> <p> We talk about:</p> <p>- Building AI systems from scratch - How Elliot has learned so much so quickly and his methods - How he approaches reading academic papers - His CS degree coursework VS his self-directed learning</p> <p>In the intro I play the 1988 Double Dragon II game soundtrack song \"Into the Turf\"</p> <p> Support for this podcast comes from a grant from Wix Studio.
