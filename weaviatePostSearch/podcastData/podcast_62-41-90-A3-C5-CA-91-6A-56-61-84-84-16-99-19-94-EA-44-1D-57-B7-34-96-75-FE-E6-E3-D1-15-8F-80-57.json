Despite achieving remarkable success with multiple teams as an agile coach, Joel and his colleagues ultimately failed because they couldn't effectively demonstrate their value to leadership. The teams were thriving, but when budget cuts came, the coaching support was eliminated first. Without ongoing support, these successful teams began to deteriorate. Joel emphasizes that as Scrum Masters and agile coaches, we must actively communicate our impact and connect team success to business outcomes. Simply assuming that good team performance speaks for itself is not enough - we need to interact more with stakeholders and clearly articulate the value we create.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this episode, we refer to the <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/ted-lasso/\"> TV series Ted Lasso</a>, and the books <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3SnhuHf\"> Start with Why by Simon Sinek</a>, and <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4kFYfVy\"> Coaching Agile Teams by Lyssa Adkins</a>.\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How effectively are you communicating the business value of your Scrum Master activities to leadership, and what specific metrics or stories could better demonstrate your impact?</p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\ude80 Global Agile Summit 2025</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Join us in  Tallinn, Estonia, from  May 18th \u2013 20th, 2025, for an event that will inspire, challenge, and equip you with  real-world Agile success stories.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83c\udf0d Connect with global Agile leaders.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udca1 Learn practical strategies for impact.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udd25 Break free from Agile fatigue and become a Pragmatic Innovator</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/the-global-agile-summit-program/?utm_source=e1125_3_smtp\">  Check Full Program</a></p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Joel Bancroft-Connors</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Joel Bancroft-Connors is The Gorilla Coach \u2014 a Certified Scrum Trainer and Agile disruptor focused on sustainable value and effectiveness.
