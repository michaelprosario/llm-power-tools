    "Description": "<p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name= \"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\" data-pm-slice= \"1 3 []\">Malcolm Matalka, founder of Terrateam, joins host\u00a0<a href= \"https://se-radio.net/team/giovanni-asproni/\">Giovanni Asproni</a> to talk about the reasoning behind choosing a not-so-widespread language (OCaml) and (almost) totally avoiding frameworks for the development of Terrateam. While discussing the reasons for choosing this specific programming language and the advantages and disadvantages of using external frameworks, they also consider a range of related topics, including static vs. dynamic typing, the use of monorepos, and the advantages of choosing a single language that can be used both for web front ends and server back ends. The episode ends with lessons learned that can be applied to other contexts and projects.</p> <p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name= \"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\" data-pm-slice= \"1 1 []\">Brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IEEE Computer Society</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.computer.org/software\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">IEEE Software magazine</a>.</p>",
