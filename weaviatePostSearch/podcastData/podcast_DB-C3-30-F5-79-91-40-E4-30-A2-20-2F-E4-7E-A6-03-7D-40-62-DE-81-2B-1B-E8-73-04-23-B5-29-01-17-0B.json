    "Description": "<p>Bert Beeckman and his partners at Forgotten Empires have brought Age of Empires back after 16 years of slumber. One of the greatest games ever now has not one, but three *official* expansion packs. Age of Empires II HD: The Forgotten, Age of Empires II HD: The African Kingdoms, and Age of Empires II HD: Rise of the Rajas all include new stories, new art, new heros, and new adventures. How is this possible? How did it start, and more importantly where can YOU buy new AoE adventures?</p>\n",
