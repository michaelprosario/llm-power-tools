    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/moving-to-the-cloud-presents-new-use-cases-for-feature-flags/\">Feature flags,</a> the toggles in software development that allow you to turn certain features on or off for certain customers or audiences, offer release management at scale, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karishmairani\">Karishma Irani,</a> head of product at LaunchDarkly.</p><p>But they also help unleash innovation, as she told host <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/hjoslyn/\">Heather Joslyn</a> of The New Stack in this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast. And that points the way to a future where the potential for easy testing can inspire new features and products, Irani said.</p><p>\u201cWe've observed that when the risk of releasing something is lowered, when the risk of introducing bugs in production or breaking, something is reduced, is lowered, our customers feel organically motivated to be more innovative and think about new ideas and take risks,\u201d she said.</p>\n",
