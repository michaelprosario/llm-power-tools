    "Title": "239: Require PR Reviews with CODEOWNERS",
    "SourceUrl": "https://fragmentedpodcast.com/",
    "Description": "<p>In this short episode, Donn talks about the CODEOWNERS file and how it can help you ensure teams review the code that they are responsible for before merging.</p><p>The CODEOWNERS file is a file that you drop into the root of your project (or into the /docs or .github/ directory) that tells GitHub (or whatever git host you're using) to require a review for any code changes that match the patterns as defined in the CODEOWNERS file. You'll specify a matching pattern and users, or teams that own that pattern of files and they will be required to review the PR before it can be merged. This helps prevent unwanted changes to files that may or may not be owned by one team or another. This is useful as teams grow larger and need more control over the changes in their application codebase.</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners\">CODEOWNERS GitHub Doc</a></li><li><a href=\"https://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/12/\">Episode 012 - CI and Collective Code Ownership</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams\">GitHub Organization Teams</a></li></ul><h2>Donn's Git Course</h2><p>Need to learn Git?
