    "Description": "<p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name= \"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\" data-pm-slice= \"1 1 []\">Will McGugan, the CEO and founder of Textualize, speaks with host <a href= \"https://se-radio.net/team/gregory-kapfhammer/\" data-prosemirror-content-type=\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name= \"link\">Gregory M. Kapfhammer</a> about how to use packages such as Rich and Textual to build text-based user interfaces (TUIs) and command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Python. Along with discussing the design idioms that enable developers to create TUIs in Python, they consider practical strategies for efficiently rendering the components of a TUI. They also explore the subtle idiosyncrasies of implementing performant TUI frameworks like Textual and Rich and introduce the steps that developers would take to create their own CLI or TUI.</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by <a href= \"https://www.fly.io?utm=seradio\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Fly.io.</a></p>",
