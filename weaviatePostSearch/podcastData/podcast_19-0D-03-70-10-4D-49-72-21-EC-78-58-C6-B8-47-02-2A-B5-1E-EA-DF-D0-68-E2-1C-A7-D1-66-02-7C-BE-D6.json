    "Description": "  Simina Fodor: The Courage to Question\u2014Signs of a Healthy Agile Team <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  For Simina, Scrum Master success goes far beyond facilitation skills \u2013 it's about what happens when you're not in the room. True success means creating a self-sustaining team that maintains healthy practices even in your absence. Simina looks for indicators like: Do team members feel safe raising concerns regularly? Can they push back with the Product Owner and offer suggestions? Do they proactively ask for the \"why\" behind requests instead of blindly following directions? She emphasizes that successful teams raise dependencies early in the sprint, have the courage to plan work with other teams, and handle integrations independently. The ultimate test of Scrum Master effectiveness is whether the team continues to thrive even when you step away for a few days.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  What specific behaviors would indicate that your team has reached a level of self-sustainability that would allow you to step back?</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Start/Stop/Continue <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Simina advocates for the simplicity of t<a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/start-stop-continue-retrospective/\">he Start/Stop/Continue retrospective format.</a>  After experimenting with numerous complex approaches, she found that sometimes the most straightforward formats yield the best results. This classic structure cuts through noise and focuses teams on what truly matters: what new practices they should begin, what isn't working and should stop, and what's effective and should continue. Simina appreciates how this format's simplicity makes it accessible and easy to follow, allowing teams to concentrate on meaningful conversation rather than getting lost in complicated retrospective mechanics.</p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\ude80 Global Agile Summit 2025</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Join us in  Tallinn, Estonia, from  May 18th \u2013 20th, 2025, for an event that will inspire, challenge, and equip you with  real-world Agile success stories.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83c\udf0d Connect with global Agile leaders.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udca1 Learn practical strategies for impact.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udd25 Break free from Agile fatigue and become a Pragmatic Innovator</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/the-global-agile-summit-program/?utm_source=e1125_3_smtp\">  Check Full Program</a></p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Simina Fodor\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Simina is a career rebel with a passion for bold moves.
