    "Description": "<p>Google for Lynda and you'll find the legendary Lynda.com. Lynda has had a popular online presence for over 12 years. She created the original Web-Safe Color palette (remember when that mattered?) and now she sells nearly 20,000 training videos online via subscription. Silverlight is next. I chat with Lynda after we had lunch with Ray Ozzie and some other bloggers.</p>\n",
