    "Description": "<p>Many people are destroyed by bullying, teasing, and the challenges of youth. Over the years, I've often contemplated why my story was so different. Why did I overcome? Why wasn't I broken beyond repair?</p> <p>Today, we celebrate 500 episodes. And I've been asked these questions many times when I share a peek of the story to friends and acquaintances. So, in a spirit of authenticity, I share the story as it happened.</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e500\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e500</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
