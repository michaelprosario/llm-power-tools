    "Description": "<p>Aras Pranckevi\u010dius reminisces about his formative years at Unity, detailing the transition from a Mac-only platform to a gaming revolution with the advent of the iPhone. He critiques Unity's package management and advocates for keeping core functionality within the main codebase. Aras favors text-based programming languages, given their clarity compared to visual nodes. He delves into 3D file formats, underscoring the resilience of simpler formats like OBJ and PLY, and prefers GLTF over the complex USD, which lacks a clear specification. Aras introduces Gaussian splatting as a more editable and understandable alternative to NeRF, outlining his work on optimizing splat data size. He acknowledges the transformative impact of AI on programming but expects it will take years for the dust to settle. Aras ends by recognizing the significant advancements of Blender in the open-source space and expresses cautious optimism for the future of 3D on the web with technologies like WebGPU\u2026</p><p>====</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Have any comments or questions?
