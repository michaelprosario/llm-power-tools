    "Description": "<p>Richard flies solo to talk to Ed Horley about getting IPv6 deployed. In February 2011, IANA exhausted all the reserve IPv4 addresses, allocating them out to the five regional internet registries. APNIC, the registry for the Asia-Pacific area, is expected to run out of IPv4 first. So 2011 is going to be a big year for IPv6, especially for content providers. If your responsible for your company putting content on the internet, you need to get thinking about IPv6. Check out http://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/ for World IPv6 Day on June 8, 2011, when all the major web sites of the world will be testing out their sites in IPv6 mode. Will you be ready?</p>\n",
