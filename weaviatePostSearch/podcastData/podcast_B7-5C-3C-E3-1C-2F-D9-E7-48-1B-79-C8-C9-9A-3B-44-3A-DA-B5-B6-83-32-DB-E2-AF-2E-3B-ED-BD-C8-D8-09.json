    "Description": "<p>According to the 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world needs to cut carbon emissions drastically to avoid the worst effects of global warming. But that\u2019s not all. In addition to reducing emissions, we also need to remove 6 to 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2050.&nbsp;</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Guy talks with Jan Wurzbacher, co-founder and CEO of Climeworks. They discuss how Jan and his team built the world\u2019s largest direct air capture facility, which filters carbon dioxide from the air and stores it permanently underground. Plus, Jan\u2019s optimistic vision of how humans can achieve the goal of reversing climate change. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
