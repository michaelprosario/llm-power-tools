    "Description": "<p>Amanda Klane and Drew Harrington are childhood friends, and co-founders of Yasso; they defied the advice of experts by creating a recipe for frozen Greek yogurt treats, and building Yasso into a $200 million dollar brand. When Amanda got the idea in 2009 to freeze Greek yogurt into popsicles, she reached out to Drew, who had already started a business selling\u2014and there\u2019s no way you could guess this\u2014inflatable beer pong tables. The two friends set out to make a high protein, low-calorie yogurt bar, and despite initial bad reviews from family, and a series of \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d from prospective manufacturers, they eventually landed Yasso onto the shelves of Costco and BJ\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t long before they faced competition from the top players in the freezer aisle, but Yasso continued to grow, and was recently acquired by one of the biggest consumer goods companies in the world. &nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
