    "Description": "<p>Meredith Akers is a principal who has been using some unconventional methods of teacher PD. In this episode, she talks about the revolutionary way she recently held teacher PD (using video instruction and face to face meetings) and what she learned. Let's give teachers choice in their professional development about what they learn. Of course, we all must continue to improve our craft of teaching and need to learn, but giving choice as to content can make professional development more relevant and helpful.</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e548\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e548</a>\u00a0</p>  <p>Advancement Courses is today's sponsor From now until September 28, Advancement Courses, an online provider of professional development for K-12 teachers, is donating 10% of their sales to funding DonorsChoose.org projects.
