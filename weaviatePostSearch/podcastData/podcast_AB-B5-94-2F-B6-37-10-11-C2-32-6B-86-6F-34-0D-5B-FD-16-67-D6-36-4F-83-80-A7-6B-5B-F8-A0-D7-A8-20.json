    "Description": "<p>Heroku has been undergoing a major transformation, re-platforming its entire Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering over the past year and a half. This ambitious effort, dubbed \u201cFir,\u201d will soon reach general availability. According to Betty Junod, CMO and SVP at Heroku (owned by Salesforce), the overhaul includes a shift to Kubernetes and OCI standards, reinforcing Heroku\u2019s commitment to open source.\u00a0</p><p>The platform now features Heroku Cloud Native Buildpacks, which let developers create container images without Dockerfiles. Originally built on Ruby on Rails and predating Docker and AWS, Heroku now supports eight programming languages. The company has also deepened its open source engagement by becoming a platinum member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), contributing to projects like OpenTelemetry. Additionally, Heroku has open sourced its Twelve-Factor Apps methodology, inviting the community to help modernize it to address evolving needs such as secrets management and workload identity. This signals a broader effort to align Heroku\u2019s future with the cloud native ecosystem.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Heroku's approach to Platform-as-a-Service:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/return-to-paas-building-the-platform-of-our-dreams/ \">Return to PaaS: Building the Platform of Our Dreams</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/heroku-moved-twelve-factor-apps-to-open-source-whats-next/ \">Heroku Moved Twelve-Factor Apps to Open Source.
