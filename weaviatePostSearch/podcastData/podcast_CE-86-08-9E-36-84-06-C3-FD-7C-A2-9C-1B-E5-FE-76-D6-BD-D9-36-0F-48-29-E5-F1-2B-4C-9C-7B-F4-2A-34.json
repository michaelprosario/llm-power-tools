    "Description": "<p>What's the state of DevOps coming into 2016? Richard chats with Gene Kim, one of the godfathers of the DevOps movement, about what he's seen over the past year and how DevOps is evolving into &quot;the way we build and operate software.&quot; Gene talks about getting management more involved in the DevOps process, recognizing that when software is built and operated in a rapidly iterating model, the way that software is sold and utilized changes as well. More and more Gene can see that DevOps is not just about the unicorn companies, but about what every business can do to build and operate better software. Have a listen!</p>\n",
