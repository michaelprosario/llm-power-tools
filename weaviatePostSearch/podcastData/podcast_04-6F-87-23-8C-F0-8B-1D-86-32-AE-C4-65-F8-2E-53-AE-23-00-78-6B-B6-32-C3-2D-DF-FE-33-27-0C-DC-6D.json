    "Description": "\n        <p>No athlete wishes for an injury, but when Kurt Ainsworth\u2019s bad shoulder derailed his professional pitching career, it created a big opportunity. Kurt and two partners started a wooden bat company in his backyard, bringing their intimate knowledge of baseball to every bat they sold. Soon, big-name players like Sammy Sosa were swinging them, but Kurt knew they had to expand to aluminum bats to reach the wider field of non-professional players. The company faced a near death experience when the NCAA decertified its bats for being too powerful, but eventually regained its footing. In 2013, Marucci Sports was acquired for over half a billion dollars; and next year, Marucci will slide past Louisville Slugger to become the official bats of Major League Baseball.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p><br></p><p>It was edited by Neva Grant with research from Katherine Sypher.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Our engineers were Maggie Luthar and Jimmy Keeley.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter</em></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em></a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
