    "SourceUrl": "https://www.superdatascience.com/863",
    "Description": "\n        <p>Jon Krohn talks tabular data with Frank Hutter, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at Universit\u00e4t Freiburg in Germany. Despite the great steps that deep learning has made in analysing images, audio, and natural language, tabular data has remained its insurmountable obstacle. In this episode, Frank Hutter details the path he has found around this obstacle even with limited data by using a ground-breaking transformer architecture. Named TabPFN, this approach is vastly outperforming other architectures, as testified by a write up of TabPFN\u2019s capabilities in Nature. Frank talks about his work on version 2 of TabPFN, the architecture\u2019s cross-industry applicability, and how TabPFN is able to return accurate results with synthetic data.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://odsc.com/boston/\">ODSC</a>, the Open Data Science Conference.
