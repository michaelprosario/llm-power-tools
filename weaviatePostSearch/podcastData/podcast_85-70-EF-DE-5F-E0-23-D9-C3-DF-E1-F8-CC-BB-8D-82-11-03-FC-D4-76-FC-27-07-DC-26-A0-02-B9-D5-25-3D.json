    "Description": "<p>In today\u2019s hiring environment, it\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone to stay on your team forever. So how do you prioritize both the success of your team/company AND support the career growth of folks on your team? Tara Ellis (Engineering Leader, Animation Content Engineering @ Netflix) shares her approach to career growth & why she encourages her team to outgrow their roles! Plus, how to help someone understand if management is the right next step and how other leaders can begin facilitating a growth mentality in their organizations.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/taraellis/\"><strong>TARA ELLIS</strong></a></h2><p>Tara Ellis (<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/maverick_mind\">@maverick_mind</a>) is an avid tinkerer and has been since the early days of the world wide web. As a critical and creative thinker, she is a relentless problem-solver skilled in applying analysis, technical knowledge, and strong interpersonal skills in her leadership style. Tara is a strong believer in \u201cPeopleware\u201d and because of that has a keen understanding of building and leading teams that deliver.</p><p>As a leader at Netflix, Tara has led diverse engineering teams including continuously improving the Payments and Non-Member Experience to bring in new Netflix members globally. Currently, she leads teams in Animation Studio and Production Engineering in building products that power the Netflix Animation Studio ecosystem. Prior to joining Netflix, she led engineering teams at Disney Parks; if you\u2019ve been to Disneyland or Disneyworld in the last decade, you\u2019ve interacted with some of her teams\u2019 software. She honed her engineering skills in the fast-paced, ever-changing environment at Amazon, learning lessons she still uses today.</p><p>Outside of work, Tara loves to spend time with her family, cooking and traveling. She is a passionate collector and player of board games and a music aficionado.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen someone joins my team, I try to spend a fair bit of time with the expectation that you are not going to be here forever. I hope you are here as long as I can keep you. As long as our journeys kind of go together.<br />But at some point, whether that be a year, three years, five years... you're going to outgrow this. That's just the nature of work. And so I like to be really upfront about that. And then I also like to prepare for that!\u201d</p><p>- Tara Ellis \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>The <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3NjjUTv\">ELC Virtual Summit</a> is BACK on April 20th-22nd!</h3><p>We\u2019re bringing together engineering leaders from around the world to surface fresh industry insights & help you build peer support.
