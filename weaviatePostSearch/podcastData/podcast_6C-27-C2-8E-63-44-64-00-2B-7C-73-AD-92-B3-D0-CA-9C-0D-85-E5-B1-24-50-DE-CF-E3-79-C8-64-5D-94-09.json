    "Description": "<p>Ryan Kazanciyan is the Chief Security Architect at Tanium, and in his spare time worked as Technical Consultant for Mr. Robot alongside writer and producer Kor Adana. Why is Mr. Robot so unique in the quality of its on-screen hacks? How does one make a hack both real AND entertaining a technical and non-technical audience?
