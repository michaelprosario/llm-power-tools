    "Description": "<p>Blockchain technology continues to drive innovation despite declining hype, with Distributed Ledgers (DLTs) offering secure, decentralized digital asset transactions. In an On the Road episode of The New Stack Makers recorded at Open Source Summit North America, Andrew Aitken of Hedera and Dr. Leemon Baird of Swirlds Labs discussed DLTs with Alex Williams.\u00a0</p><p>Baird highlighted the Hashgraph Consensus Algorithm, an efficient, secure distributed consensus mechanism he created, leveraging a hashgraph data structure and gossip protocol for rapid, robust transaction sharing among network nodes. This algorithm, which has been open source under the Apache 2.0 license for nine months, aims to maintain decentralization by involving 32 global organizations in its governance. Aitken emphasized building an ecosystem of DLT contributors, adhering to open source best practices, and developing cross-chain applications and more wallets to enhance exchange capabilities. This collaborative approach seeks to ensure transparency in both governance and software development. For more insights into DLT\u2019s 2.0 era, listen to the full episode.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Distributed Ledgers (DLTs)\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/iota-distributed-ledger-beyond-blockchain-for-supply-chains/\">IOTA Distributed Ledger: Beyond Blockchain for Supply Chains\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/why-i-changed-my-mind-about-blockchain/\">Why I Changed My Mind About Blockchain\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
