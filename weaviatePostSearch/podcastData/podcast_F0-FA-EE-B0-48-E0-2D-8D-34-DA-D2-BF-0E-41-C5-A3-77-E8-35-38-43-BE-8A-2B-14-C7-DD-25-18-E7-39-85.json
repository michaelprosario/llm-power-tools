    "Description": "<p>Biilmann says we can't ignore the impact GenAI is having on developer productivity. \u00a0One of their engineers created a \u00a0GPT that automatically generates stories for React + TypeScript components, and after seeing how successful it was internally, Netlify <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/blog/build-your-own-storybook-gpt/\">made it open source for the public</a>.</p><p>We also chat over the results of their recent <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/press/netlify-report-reveals-increased-adoption-of-composable-web-architecture/\">State of Web Development</a> survey. The key takeaway is below:\u00a0</p><p><i>The 80% of developers that have integrated AI into their workflow are quickly reaping the benefits. Seventy percent report using AI to automate manual and repetitive tasks and 42% are using it to improve internal knowledge sharing and increase productivity, freeing up more time for impactful work and enabling faster launch times. Over 50% of developers also realized new opportunities that AI created, such as generating new web projects with a single prompt or reading API documentation.</i></p><p><i>However, AI experimentation is not without its own unique challenges. Developers are concerned about receiving incorrect answers and information (65%), security issues and leaking confidential information (52%), a lack of regulation (48%), and a decrease in code quality (45%).</i></p><p>So much opportunity, but plenty of risk as well.\u00a0</p><p>Last but not least, Biilmann tells us what he's looking forward to in the near future, specifically apps that can reformat their UI on the fly to be more customized to each user. He calls this UI 2.0, and it sounds a bit like what Google showed off in its recent Gemini demo.\u00a0</p><p>Congrats to our lifeboat winner of the week, Petrus Theron, who answered the question: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53866508/how-can-i-make-a-public-struct-where-all-fields-are-public-without-repeating-pu/53869723#53869723\">How can I make a public struct where all fields are public without repeating `pub` for every field?</a></p>\n",
