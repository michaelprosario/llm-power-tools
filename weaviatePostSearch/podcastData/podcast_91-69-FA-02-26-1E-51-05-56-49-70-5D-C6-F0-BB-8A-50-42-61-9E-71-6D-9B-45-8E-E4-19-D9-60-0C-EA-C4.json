Understandably, if we are going to have long-term success in education, we have got to begin focusing on the well-being of our teachers. Now, in my 22nd year of teaching, I look back and wish I had known many of these lessons sooner. So, let's embrace the new year and reflect on what we can learn from the stresses and messes of this past fall and take the opportunity to renew our commitment to not just teaching but thriving in our classrooms.</p> <p>Show Notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e825\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e825</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
