    "Description": "<p>In this New Stack Makers podcast, Xun Wang, CTO of Bloomreach, brings insights from his time at Nvidia, particularly lessons from its founder, Jensen Huang, to his current role in e-commerce personalization. Wang emphasizes structuring organizations to reflect the architecture of the products they build, applying a hands-on, detail-oriented approach that encourages deep understanding of engineering challenges.\u00a0</p><p>He credits Huang for teaching him the importance of focusing on fundamental architecture rather than relying on iterative testing alone. Wang highlights the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on Bloomreach, explaining how AI-driven search is essential to understanding human language and user intent. As GenAI reshapes application development, Wang stresses the need for engineers to adopt new skills in AI manipulation, while still maintaining traditional coding expertise. He advocates for continuous learning, acknowledging the challenge of staying updated in a rapidly evolving field. Wang, himself, reads extensively to keep pace with innovations, underscoring the importance of staying curious and adaptable in today\u2019s tech landscape.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Entrepreneurship for Engineers:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/entrepreneurship-for-engineers-how-to-grow-into-leadership/ \">How to Grow into Leadership\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/engineering-leaders-switch-to-wartime-management-now/ \">Engineering Leaders: Switch to Wartime Management Now\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-teleports-leader-transitioned-from-engineer-to-ceo/ \">How Teleport\u2019s Leader Transitioned from Engineer to CEO\u00a0</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a>\u00a0</p>\n",
