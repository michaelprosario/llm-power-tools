    "Description": "\n        If you could make a single hire that would revolutionize your productivity, would you do it? Of course we all would say yes. But we\u2019ve found that most leaders procrastinate when it comes to hiring an executive assistant. That\u2019s right, an EA is the most important hire you\u2019ll ever make. Having a good assistant makes you incredibly productive by taking on your low-leverage tasks and helping you channel your time and energy where you can be most effective. That creates an instant boost in productivity! But lots of us put off hiring an EA out of fear. We\u2019re afraid we can\u2019t afford it, or we\u2019ll lose control of important tasks, or there won\u2019t be enough for them to do. We\u2019re here to tell you that simply isn\u2019t true! In fact, we\u2019re so convinced that hiring an EA will skyrocket your productivity that we\u2019re devoting the entire episode to showing you how and why to do it. \u00a0 Plus? We have a visit from Jim Kelly and Jamie Hess, our executive assistants, who give a behind-the-scenes look at what it\u2019s like to work with us. Here\u2019s happening in this episode\u2014  We give you our top three reasons why you should hire an EA right now. We promise, you won\u2019t regret it. We each reveal the top tasks we depend on our assistants to accomplish\u2014because we\u2019re really not good at them! You\u2019ll discover the ways having an EA boosts margin and improves family time. Jim and Jamie will tell you the number one task you need to hand off (and probably don\u2019t know it). We outline the first steps to hiring an EA, which are much easier than you\u2019d think.
