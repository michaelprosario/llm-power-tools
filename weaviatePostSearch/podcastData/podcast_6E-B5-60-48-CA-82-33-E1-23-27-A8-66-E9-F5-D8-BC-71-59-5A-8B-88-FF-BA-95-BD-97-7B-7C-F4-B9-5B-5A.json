    "Description": "<p>TNS host Alex Williams is joined by Florian Valeye, a data engineer at Back Market, to shed light on the evolving landscape of data engineering, particularly focusing on Delta Lake and his contributions to open source communities. As a member of the Delta Lake community, Valeye discusses the intersection of data warehouses and data lakes, emphasizing the need for a unified platform that breaks down traditional barriers.</p><p>Delta Lake, initially created by Databricks and now under the Linux Foundation, aims to enhance reliability, performance, and quality in data lakes. Valeye explains how Delta Lake addresses the challenges posed by the separation of data warehouses and data lakes, emphasizing the importance of providing asset transactions, real-time processing, and scalable metadata.</p><p>Valeye's involvement in Delta Lake began as a response to the challenges faced at Back Market, a global marketplace for refurbished devices. The platform manages large datasets, and Delta Lake proved to be a pivotal solution in optimizing ETL processes and facilitating communication between data scientists and data engineers.</p><p>The conversation delves into Valeye's journey with Delta Lake, his introduction to Rust programming language, and his role as a maintainer in the Rust-based library for Delta Lake. Valeye emphasizes Rust's importance in providing a high-level API with reliability and efficiency, offering a balanced approach for developers.</p><p>Looking ahead, Valeye envisions Delta Lake evolving beyond traditional data engineering, becoming a platform that seamlessly connects data scientists and engineers. He anticipates improvements in data storage optimization and envisions Delta Lake serving as a standard format for machine learning and AI applications.</p><p>The conversation concludes with Valeye reflecting on his future contributions, expressing a passion for Rust programming and an eagerness to explore evolving projects in the open-source community.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Delta Lake and The Linux Foundation:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/delta-lake-a-layer-to-ensure-data-quality/\">Delta Lake: A Layer to Ensure Data Quality</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/data-2023-revenge-of-the-sql-nerds/\">Data in 2023: Revenge of the SQL Nerds</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/what-do-you-know-about-your-linux-system/\">What Do You Know about Your Linux System?</a></p>\n",
