    "Description": "<p>We chat with Donald Farmer about data mining with the Analysis Services components of Microsoft's SQL Server 2005. Donald takes us away from the traditional business-use of data mining (like a 'people who liked this book also liked' application) and into the idea that we can mine our application and event logs for data that will help the IT pro optimize and anticipate problems in the information systems.</p>\n",
