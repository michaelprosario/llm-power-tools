I use a free program called <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/planboard?utm_source=coolcatteacher\">Planboard</a> for my lesson planning. My school uses Planboard with <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/\">Chalk.com</a>\u2019s curriculum planning tool. This powerful tool links with standards -- and gives us the ability to do some timesaving, efficient reporting and tracking. The best thing about Planboard is I can plan my lessons anywhere - on my Mac, PC or iPad. Wherever I work, my lesson plans are with me. And as I said, Planboard is FREE for teachers. I hope you\u2019ll check out Planboard now!</p> <p>Resources from the Podcast:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://app.edu.buncee.com/\">Buncee</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.zigazoo.com/\">Zigazoo</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nearpod.com/\">Nearpod</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://edpuzzle.com/\">Edpuzzle</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://goformative.com/\">Formative</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wakelet.com/\">Wakelet</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://gosynth.com/m/education/\">Gosynth</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.gimkit.com/\">Gimkit</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://quizizz.com/\">Quizziz</a>\u00a0</li> </ul> Rachelle Dene Poth - Bio as Submitted <p>Rachelle Dene Poth is an edtech consultant, presenter, attorney, author, and teacher.
