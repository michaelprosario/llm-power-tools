I think it's very easy to fall into the trap of having a very full calendar, feeling very busy, feeling like there's so many things to do and the things that you do don't move the needle in any way.\u201d<br /><br />- Cal Henderson \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariakaz/\"><strong>MARIA KAZANDJIEVA</strong></a></h2><p>Maria (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stranger_quark\">@stranger_quark</a>) is a co-founder and an engineering leader at Graft, an early-stage AI startup.
