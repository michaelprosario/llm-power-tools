    "Description": "<p>Dr. Lydia Gonzalez, author of \"Bad at Math: Dismantling Harmful Beliefs That Hinder Equitable Mathematics Education,\" talks about the societal norms that make it acceptable to be \"bad at math\" and how these beliefs can be detrimental to learning. Dr. Gonzalez emphasizes the importance of broadening our understanding of math and its relevance in everyday life. We also discuss the critical role of relationships and a growth mindset in effective teaching, particularly in math subjects that many find intimidating. Let's explore how to dismantle harmful beliefs in math education and create a more equitable learning environment.</p> <p>Snow notes and transcript: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e819\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e819</a></p> <p>Sponsor: This show is sponsored by Microsoft.
