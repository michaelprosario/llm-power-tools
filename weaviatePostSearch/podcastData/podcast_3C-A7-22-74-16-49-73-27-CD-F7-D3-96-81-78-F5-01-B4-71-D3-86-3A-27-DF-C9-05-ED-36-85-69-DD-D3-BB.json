    "Description": "<p>Feature flags \u2014 the on/off toggles, written in conditional statements, that allow organizations greater control over the user experience once code has been deployed \u2014 \u00a0are proliferating and growing more complex, and demand robust feature management, said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karishmairani/\">Karishma Irani,</a> head of product at LaunchDarkly, in this episode of The New Stack Makers.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In a November survey by LaunchDarkly, which queried more than 1,000 DevOps professionals, \u00a0<a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/launchdarkly-feature-management-is-a-must-have/\">69% of participants said that feature flags are \u201cmust-have, mission-critical and/or high priority\u201d</a> for their organizations.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/whats-the-future-of-feature-management-feature-flags/\">Feature management,</a> we believe, is a modern practice that's becoming more and more common with companies that want to deploy more frequently, innovate faster, and just keep a healthy engineering team,\u201d Irani said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The idea of feature management, Irani said, is to \u201cmaximize value while minimizing risk.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>LaunchDarkly uses its own software, she said, and eating its own dog food, as the saying goes, has paid off in gaining insights into user needs.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>As part of LaunchDarkly\u2019s <a href=\"https://launchdarkly.com/trajectory/2022/\">virtual conference Trajectory</a> in November, Irani joined <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/hjoslyn/\">Heather Joslyn,</a> features editor of The New Stack, for a wide-ranging conversation about the latest developments in feature management.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This episode of Makers was sponsored by LaunchDarkly.</p><p><h2>Automating Approvals</h2></p><p>As an example of the benefits of having first-hand knowledge of how their company's products are used, Irani pointed to an internal project in mid-2022.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>When the company migrated from [sponsor_inline_mention slug=\"mongodb\" ]MongoDB[/sponsor_inline_mention] to CockroachDB, it used new capabilities in its Feature Workflows product, which allow users to define a workflow that can schedule the gradual release of a feature flag for a future date and time, and automate approval requests.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll of these async processes around approvals schedules, they're critical to releasing software, but they do slow you down and add more potential for manual error or human error,\u201d Irani said. \u201cAnd so our goal with Feature Workflows was to essentially automate the entire process of a feature release.\u201d</p><p><h2>Overhauling Experimentation</h2></p><p>This past June, the company also revised its Experimentation offering, she said. Led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescfrost/\">James Frost,</a> LaunchDarkly\u2019s head of experimentation, the team did \u201ca complete overhaul of our stats engine, they enhanced the integration path of our customers\u2019 existing data sets and metrics,\u201d Irani said. \u201cThey redesigned our UX and the codified model and experimentation best practices into the product itself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For instance, a new metric import API helps prevent the problem of multiple teams or users within a company using different tools for A/B and other experiments. It \u201csignificantly cuts down on manual duplicate work when importing metrics for experimentation,\u201d said Irani. \u201cSo you can get set up faster.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Another addition to the Experimentation product is a sample ratio mismatch test, she said, so \u201cyou can be confident that all of your experiments are correctly allocating traffic to each variant.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>These innovations, along with new capabilities to the company\u2019s Core Flagging Platform, are in general availability. On the horizon \u2014 and now available through <a href=\"https://launchdarkly.com/EAP\">LaunchDarkly\u2019s early access program,</a> is Accelerate, which lets users track and visualize key engineering metrics, such as deployment frequency, release frequency, lead time for code changes, and flag coverage.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI'm sure you've caught on already,\u201d Irani said, \u201cbut a few of these are <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/googles-formula-for-elite-devops-performance/\">Dora metrics,</a> which obviously are extremely critical to our users.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Check out the entire episode for more details on what\u2019s new from LaunchDarkly and the problems that innovators in the feature management space still need to solve.</p>\n",
