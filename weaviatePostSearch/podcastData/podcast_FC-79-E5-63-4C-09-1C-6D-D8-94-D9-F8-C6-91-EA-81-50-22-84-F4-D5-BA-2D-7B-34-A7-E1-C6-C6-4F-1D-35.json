    "Description": "\n        After Robin McBride and Andr\u00e9a McBride John made the extraordinary discovery that they were half-sisters, they formed a deep bond and discovered a mutual dream: to create a wine company that would demystify wine culture and attract a wider audience. In the mid-2000s, they staked their life savings on an importer's license and began selling New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to high-end restaurants, eventually partnering with larger companies to test out their blends and learn more about the business. In 2016, they decided to take a leap and create their own collection. Today, their wine\u2014including the signature brand Black Girl Magic\u2014is on grocery shelves across the country, and the McBride Sisters Collection is one of the biggest Black-owned wine companies in the world. <br/><br/>Order the How I Built This book at: <a href=\"https://smarturl.it/HowIBuiltThis\">https://smarturl.it/HowIBuiltThis</a><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
