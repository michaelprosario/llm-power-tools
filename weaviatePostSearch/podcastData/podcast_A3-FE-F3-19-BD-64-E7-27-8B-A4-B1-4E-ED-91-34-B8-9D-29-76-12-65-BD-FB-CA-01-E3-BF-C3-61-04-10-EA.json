    "Description": "<p>Richard and Greg talk to Rodney Buike about the upcoming Office 2010. While he couldn't commit to a launch date (go search online, there's lots of rumors), it is safe to say that Office 2010 will ship in 2010. Rodney digs into the relevant changes in the suite, including the focus on Microsoft's &quot;three screens&quot; strategy, providing equal access online, on the desktop and on mobile devices. Check out the Office Product team blog at http://blogs.technet.com/office2010 and the Outlook 2010 Beta at http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/.</p>\n",
