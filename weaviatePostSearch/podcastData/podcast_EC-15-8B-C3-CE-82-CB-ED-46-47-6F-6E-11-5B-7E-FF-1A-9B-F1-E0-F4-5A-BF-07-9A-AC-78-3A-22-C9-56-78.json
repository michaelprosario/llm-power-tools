    "Description": "M. Night Shyamalan spoke with Guy as part of NPR's Storytelling Lounge at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Night is known for writing, producing and directing blockbuster films like <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, <em>Unbreakable</em> and <em>Split</em>. Despite his many successes, Night shares that he still faces self-doubt, fearing every new project may be his last. He spoke with Guy about the production of his new film <em>Old </em>and the new season of his Apple TV Plus show <em>Servant</em>, both of which were filmed during the pandemic. <br/>These conversations are excerpts from our <em>How I Built Resilienc</em>e series, where Guy talks online with founders and industry leaders about how they're navigating turbulent times.<p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
