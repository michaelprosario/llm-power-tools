    "Description": "<p>Erica Boomsma is in South Dakota where they have been teaching in face to face school for the last four weeks. She talks about the fears she had in going back, the protocols they are using and the positive experiences they are having amidst the masks and shields. Face to face school may be a better alternative than many imagine - even those who struggle with worry. Listen to Erica's experience and figure out how you can prepare yourself and your students for the day you walk back into your classroom.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e704\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e704</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Sponsor: Planboard & Chalk As we prepare to teach in a blended or distance learning environment, a rock-solid lesson planner is a must. I use a free program called <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/planboard?utm_source=coolcatteacher\">Planboard</a> for my lesson planning. My school uses Planboard with <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/\">Chalk.com</a>\u2019s curriculum planning tool. This powerful tool links with standards -- and gives us the ability to do some timesaving, efficient reporting and tracking. The best thing about Planboard is I can plan my lessons anywhere - on my Mac, PC or iPad. Wherever I work, my lesson plans are with me. And as I said, Planboard is FREE for teachers. I hope you\u2019ll check out Planboard now!</p> Erica Boomsma - Bio as Submitted <p>Erica Boomsma is a dedicated 4th Grade Teacher with 18 years of experience teaching a culturally diverse student population in Huron, South Dakota.
