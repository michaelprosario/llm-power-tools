My biggest job was to really bring all the VPs together. What does it mean for them to work together, behave well together, and respect each other? And it's all because there were all these silos of departments. If you look at the power of AI, AI knows no boundaries. If anything, it needs the entire knowledge graph and the knowledge graph of customers and product and people and their work, not just people on the inside, but also users and their activities on the outside. That's a big problem that we all have to go and solve for.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Dheeraj Pandey \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://testrigor.com/?utm_source=ELC&utm_medium=paid-ad&utm_campaign=FY24-Q1-ELC-podcast&utm_content=home-page&utm_term=view\">testRigor</a>!</h2><p><a href=\"https://testrigor.com/?utm_source=ELC&utm_medium=paid-ad&utm_campaign=FY24-Q1-ELC-podcast&utm_content=home-page&utm_term=view\">testRigor</a> is trusted by tens of thousands of companies across the globe, including Netflix, Splunk, BusinessWire, and more to solve three main problems with end-to-end test automation:</p><ol><li>It\u2019s challenging, expensive, and slow to hire QA Automation Engineers</li><li>Low productivity building your own QA Automation</li><li>Fragile tests, that cause maintenance to consume enormous amounts of time</li></ol><h3>testRigor solves all of the above by allowing our users to express test cases in plain English</h3><h3>To learn more, check out a case study on testRigor <a href=\"https://testrigor.com/assets/pdf/IDT_testRigor_case_study.pdf\">here</a></h3><h3>Sign up for a free trial today at <a href=\"http://testrigor.com/\">testrigor.com</a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>The role of essentialism in software dev & company building (1:52)</li><li>Dheeraj\u2019s experience fostering a customer-centric approach in all teams (4:22)</li><li>Commonly used tools & why they fall short for full eng functions (7:20)</li><li>Why it\u2019s important to connect AI, analytics & collaboration features (10:15)</li><li>How AI can help solve information asymmetry (13:12)</li><li>Using AI for analytics to help make teams more customer-centric (15:14)</li><li>Audience Q&As: A day in the life of a PM using LLMs in an interactive discussion (18:03)</li><li>Tips for educating users to provide better prompts when using GenAI (22:50)</li><li>How would a company typically use the DevRev product?
