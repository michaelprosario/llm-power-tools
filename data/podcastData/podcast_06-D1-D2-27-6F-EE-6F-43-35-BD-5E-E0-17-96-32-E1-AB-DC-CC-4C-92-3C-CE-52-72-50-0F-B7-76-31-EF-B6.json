    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://passage.id/\">Passage</a> adds device native biometric authorization to web sites to allow passwordless security on devices with or without Touch ID.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers, Passage Co-Founders Cole Hecht and Anna Pobletts talk about how the service works for developers to offer users its biometric service.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Hecht and Pobletts have worked in product security for many years and the recurring problem is always password-based security. But there really is no great solution, Pobletts said. Multi-factor authentication adds security but the user experience is lacking. <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/stytchs-api-first-approach-to-passwordless-authentication/\">Magic links</a>, <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-to-optimize-customer-identity-and-access-management/\">adaptive MFA</a>, and other techniques add a bit of improvement but are not a great balance of user experience and security.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhereas biometrics is the only option we've ever seen that gives you both great security and great user experience right out of the box,\u201d Pobletts.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The goal for Hecht and Pobletts: offer developers what is challenging to implement themselves: a passwordless service with a high security level and a great user experience.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Passage is built on WebAuthn, a Web protocol that allows a developer to connect Web sites with browsers and various devices through the authenticators on those devices, Pobletts said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo that could be anything right now,\u201d Pobletts said. \u201cIt's things like fingerprint readers and face identification. But in the future, it could be voice identification, or it could be, you know, your presence and things like that like it could be all sorts of stuff in the future. But ultimately, your device is generating a cryptographic key pair and storing the private key in the TPM of your device. The cool thing about this protocol is that your biometric data never leaves your device, it's a huge win for privacy. In that passage, your browser, no one ever actually sees your fingerprint data in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s cryptographically secure under the hood with Passage as the platform on top, Pobletts said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://webauthn.guide/\">WebAuthn</a> is designed for single devices, Pobletts said. A developer authenticated one fingerprint, for example, to one device. But that does not work well on the Internet where a user may have a phone, a tablet, and a computer. Passage coordinates and orchestrates between different devices to give an easy experience.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo in my case, I have an iPhone, I do face ID,\u201d said Hecht showing the service. \u201cAnd then I'm going to be signed in on both devices automatically. So that's a great way to kind of give every user access to the site no matter what device they're on.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>With Passage, the biometric is added to any device a user adds, Hecht said. Passage handles the multidevice orchestration.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Use cases?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFinTech people like the security properties of it, they kind of like that cool, shiny user experience that they want to deliver to their end users,\u201d Hecht said. And then any website or business that cares about conversions is kind of a general term. People who want signups, who are trying to measure success by the number of people registering and creating accounts, are signing up. \u201cPassage has a really nice story for that because we cut out so much friction around those conversion points.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
