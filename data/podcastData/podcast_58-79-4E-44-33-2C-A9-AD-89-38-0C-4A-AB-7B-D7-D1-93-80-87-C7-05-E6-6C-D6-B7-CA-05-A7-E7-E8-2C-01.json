    "Description": "<p>In today's episode, Dr. Keith Duggar, Alex Stenlake and Dr. Tim Scarfe chat about the education chapter in Kenneth Stanley's \"Greatness cannot be planned\" book, and we relate it to our Algoshambes conversation a few weeks ago. We debate whether objectives in education are a good thing and whether they cause perverse incentives and stifle creativity and innovation. Next up we dissect capsule networks from the top down! We finish off talking about fast algorithms and quantum computing.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:00 Introduction</p>\n<p>00:01:13 Greatness cannot be planned / education&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:12:03 Perverse incentives</p>\n<p>00:19:25 Treasure hunting&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:30:28 Capsule Networks</p>\n<p>00:46:08 Capsules As Compositional Networks</p>\n<p>00:52:45 Capsule Routing</p>\n<p>00:57:10 Loss and Warps</p>\n<p>01:09:55 Fast Algorithms and Quantum Computing</p>\n",
