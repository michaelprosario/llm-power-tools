    "Description": "<p> Today I'm joined by Kevin Miller. He's a senior developer and host of the Coder Conversations YouTube channel.</p> <p>Kevin studied accounting in Texas and worked overnight for 7 years at hotels, making only $11 an hour. But his knowledge of spreadsheets lead to him learning more about programming and automation.</p> <p>After spending a year living with his parents and teaching himself to code full time, Kevin landed his first developer job. He immediately tripled his income.\u00a0</p> <p>Kevin has since worked as a dev at several Fortune 500 companies. But it's been a bumpy ride. He's been laid off 3 times due to mergers and employers just running out of money.</p> <p>He started Coder Conversations as a way for him and fellow developers to talk about technology and share career advice. He now has 200 episodes.</p> <p>I hope you're digging these weekly freeCodeCamp podcasts. Be sure to leave us a review.
