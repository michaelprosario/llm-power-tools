    "Description": "<p>No matter how much we prepare, deployments don\u2019t always go as planned. In this edition of <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/podcasts/makers\">The New Stack Makers</a> podcast, hosted by <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a>, founder and publisher of The New Stack, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelle-miller/\">Isabelle Miller</a>, software engineer, <a href=\"https://learn.launchdarkly.com/demo/?utm_content=inline-mention\" target=\"_blank\">LaunchDarkly</a>, describes how DevOps teams can build processes to help remove unwanted surprises during release cycles \u2014\u00a0 and why they do not need to be stressful.</p><p>One of the main things Miller said she has discovered since joining LaunchDarkly at the beginning of 2020 is the importance of having procedures in place for when things do go wrong, \u201cbecause things are going to go wrong,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be able to manage that problem as quickly as possible, and minimize any harm before things get out of control when that happens,\u201d said Miller. \u201cSo, one of the great things about working at LaunchDarkly is that I get to use our products. And one of the wonderful things about LaunchDarkly\u2019s feature flags is that you can just turn things off.\u201d</p>\n",
