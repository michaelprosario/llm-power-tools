    "Description": "<p>Jason C. McDonald, author of the book <em>Dead Simple Python</em>, speaks with host <a href= \"../../team/sam-taggart/\">Samuel Taggart</a> about leveraging quantified tasks to improve estimation, particularly across projects. They discuss the origin of the concept and its relationship with story points, and Jason offers examples to show how quantified tasks can capture nuances in software tasks that are often lost with story points. He also points to the ability to compare them across projects as a major advantage of quantified tasks. Among other topics, they consider also how to use quantified tasks to analyze the stability of a codebase. Brought to you by IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Software magazine.</p>",
