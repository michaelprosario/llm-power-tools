    "Description": "Not everyone has fast internet, or access to internet at all. It might be because it's too expensive, or simply that the infrastructure isn't there. Whatever the reason, high-speed internet isn't as universal as we might think. But what does that mean for developers? How do we build products that work even without fast internet? Carmen breaks it down and tells us all about the offline-first movement. We've also got an episode of Tales from the Command Line that's all about what offline-first means at the infrastructure level. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
