    "Description": "<p>In 2014, Ben Weprin decided to take people\u2019s best college memories and spin them into a new business: Graduate Hotels. Each of the chain\u2019s properties was decorated to reflect the character of the college town in which it was based, with photos of famous alums or life-sized sports mascots in the lobby. After 13 years in commercial real estate, Ben got the idea for Graduate after renovating a dilapidated Days Inn in Chicago, and realizing that a hotel can tell a story as well as\u2014maybe even better than\u2014a box of cereal or a pair of shoes. Although the Covid lockdowns threatened to bankrupt Graduate, Ben was able to secure the chain\u2019s future by selling it to Hilton, and today the 35 (+) chain is expected to add dozens more properties.</p><p>This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
