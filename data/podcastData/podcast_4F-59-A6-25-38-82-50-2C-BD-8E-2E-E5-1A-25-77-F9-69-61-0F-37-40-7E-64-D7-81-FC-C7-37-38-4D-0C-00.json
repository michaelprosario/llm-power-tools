    "Description": "<p>What does it take to build a great cybersecurity team? Richard chats with Paula Januszkiewicz  about the work she's doing to create more cybersecurity professionals. The challenge is that cybersecurity still isn't really a profession - there are no certifying bodies out there that take on responsibility for their members. Paula talks about different certifications you can get, but in the end, doing the work is the most important thing - and how you approach security problems. It's a full-time task - if you can't think about security all the time, it's hard to keep up!</p>\n",
