    "Description": "<p>Before Jim VandeHei co-founded the media company Politico,&nbsp;the only thing he\u2019d managed was the night shift at Little Caesar\u2019s pizza in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.&nbsp;An early passion for politics and journalism led him to Washington, D.C., where he became a political reporter for Roll Call, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.&nbsp;But by 2006, he could see how the internet was transforming journalism, so he walked away from the Post to co-found a digital publication\u2014Politico\u2014with the goal of setting the daily agenda for Washington\u2019s power elite.&nbsp;With the financial backing of a local media mogul, Politico took off, but Jim eventually grew frustrated managing a company he didn\u2019t own.&nbsp;So in 2017, he took another leap and co-founded Axios, a news website that gained a following for its bullet-point brevity, ready-made for the internet. Both companies have landed well: last year Axios was acquired by Cox Enterprises for over $500 million, and in 2021, Politico was purchased by Axel Springer for a reported $1 billion.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
