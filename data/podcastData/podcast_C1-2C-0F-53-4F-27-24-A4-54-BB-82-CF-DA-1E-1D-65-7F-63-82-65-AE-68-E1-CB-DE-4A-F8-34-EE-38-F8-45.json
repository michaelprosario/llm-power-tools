    "Description": "<p>In a small beach town on Australia\u2019s sunshine coast, Koel Thomae tasted a yogurt that would change her life: creamy, infused with honey and piquant with passion fruit, it became an obsession\u2013something she was determined to recreate in her adopted home of Boulder, Colorado. With no knowledge of dairy, Koel forged an 8,000 mile partnership between the Australian yogurt-makers and a Colorado dairyman. Noosa Yoghurt faced a near-death experience as the founders scrambled to meet the pace of demand; but by 2018, the brand was available in 25,000 stores, with over $200M in sales. Today, the company is owned by the food conglomerate Campbell\u2019s.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p><br></p><p>It was edited by Neva Grant with research from Olivia Rockeman.</p><p><br></p><p>Our audio engineers were Robert Rodriguez and Gilly Moon.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
