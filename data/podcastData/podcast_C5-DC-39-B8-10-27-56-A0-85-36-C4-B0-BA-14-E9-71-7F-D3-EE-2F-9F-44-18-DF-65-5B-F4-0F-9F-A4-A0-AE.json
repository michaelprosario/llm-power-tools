    "Description": "<p>What can agentic AI do for you? Richard talks to Tim Warner about his work utilizing next generation agentic AI technologies to help with sysadmin tasks. Tim talks about the early lead that Cursor AI took with AI agents capable of writing and executing scripts on your behalf - as opposed to just creating code you can cut-and-paste. Today, GitHub Copilot has caught up with Agent Mode in Copilot Edits, although still in preview, it speaks to a future where sysadmins use these tools to write better scripts for work - and get more done in less time!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor AI</a></li><li><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/\">OpenAI Operator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\">GitHub Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits\">Copilot Edits</a></li></ul><p>Recorded February 17, 2025</p>\n",
