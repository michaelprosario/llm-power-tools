    "Description": "<p>Jeremy Henrickson VP Engineering & Product @ Rippling shares how to align, lead and scale a combined engineering and product organization! You\u2019ll learn about the common tension points while scaling, different ways to structure your org, when to combine your orgs vs. split, and how to realign your teams when expectations get out of sync. Plus how to build credibility with new teams and acquire product skills as an engineering leader!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhen I have like a number of teams and each of them has like a product leader AND an engineering leader... the expectation that I set with them is like, \"Look, you guys are gonna have different points of view. And that's okay. But when you come to me, you either need to one, have a really clear, shared point of view on something, because you've gone into this together and have thought it out. Or a clear point of disagreement, so that you know, we can tie break on, okay, which one of these is actually more important right now?\"</i></p><p><i>And either one of those is totally fine. But a shared understanding of the facts, a shared understanding of the trade-offs is sort of the floor that I draw on those conversations.\u201d</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>JEREMY HENRICKSON, VP PRODUCT & ENGINEERING @ RIPPLING</strong></p><p>Jeremy Henrickson is responsible for scaling a world-class engineering team across two continents.
