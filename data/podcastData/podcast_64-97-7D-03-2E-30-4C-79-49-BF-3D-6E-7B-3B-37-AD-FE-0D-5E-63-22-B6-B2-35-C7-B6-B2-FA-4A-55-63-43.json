Either you\u2019re too perfectionistic, or too much of a people pleaser, or so much of a conflict avoider that you have trouble getting things done. It\u2019s frustrating and discouraging to fall into the same old traps over and over. </p> <p>There\u2019s a better way. We\u2019ve got expert advice on a proven, helpful system for understanding your unique stressors and motivations, and those of the people around you.
