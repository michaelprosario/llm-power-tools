    "Description": "<p>What's new in SQL Server 2019? Richard chats with Brent Ozar about his take on the latest version of SQL Server. Is there any more to do? Apparently yes! Some features are a bit more questionable, like Java support in SQL Server. But others make a ton of sense, including more analytics, more insights and better support for containers. It all depends on what you want to do with SQL Server. Brent talks about how the culture of DBAs is changing and how that is reflected in SQL Server itself. There's more data to store than ever!</p>\n",
