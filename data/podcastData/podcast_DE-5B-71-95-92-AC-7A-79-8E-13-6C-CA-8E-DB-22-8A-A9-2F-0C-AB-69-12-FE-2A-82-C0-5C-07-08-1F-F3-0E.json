    "Description": "<p>In this New Stack Makers podcast,\u00a0Ben Wilcock, a senior technical marketing architect for Tanzu, spoke with TNS editor-in-chief, Heather Joslyn and discussed the challenges organizations face when building internal developer platforms, particularly the issue of scope, at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America.\u00a0</p><p>He emphasized the difficulty for platform engineering teams to select and integrate various Kubernetes projects amid a plethora of options. Wilcock highlights the complexity of tracking software updates, new features, and dependencies once choices are made. He underscores the advantage of having a standardized approach to software deployment, preventing errors caused by diverse mechanisms.\u00a0</p><p>Tanzu aims to simplify the adoption of platform engineering and internal developer platforms, offering a turnkey approach with the Tanzu Application Platform. This platform is designed to be flexible, malleable, and functional out of the box. Additionally, Tanzu has introduced the Tanzu Developer Portal, providing a focal point for developers to share information and facilitating faster progress in platform engineering without the need to integrate numerous open source projects.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Tanzu and internal developer platforms:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/vmware-unveils-a-pile-of-new-data-services-for-its-cloud/ \">VMware Unveils a Pile of New Data Services for Its Cloud VMware\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/vmware-expands-tanzu-into-a-full-platform-engineering-environment/ \">VMware Expands Tanzu into a Full Platform Engineering Environment</a>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/vmware-targets-the-platform-engineer/ \">VMware Targets the Platform Engineer</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a></p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
