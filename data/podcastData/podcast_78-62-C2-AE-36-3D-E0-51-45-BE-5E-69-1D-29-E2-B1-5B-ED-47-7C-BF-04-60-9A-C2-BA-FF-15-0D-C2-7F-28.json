    "Description": "<p>Redefine Meat co-founder and CEO Eshchar Ben-Shitrit long had aspirations to lead a company, though he never imagined taking the risk to start his own. But learning about the environmental harms of mass beef production, plus having to answer his kids\u2019 questions about what happens to baby cows at certain farms, was enough to convince him to say goodbye to corporate life and join the plant-based revolution.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Eshchar recounts his path from product manager to marketing executive to Redefine Meat \u2014 the company he launched in 2018 to commercialize 3D-printed, plant-based steaks. Today the company\u2019s printed beef, lamb and pig alternatives can be found across Israel and Europe, with imminent plans to enter the U.S. market.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson and edited by John Isabella, with research by Chris Maccini.</p><p>Our music was composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
