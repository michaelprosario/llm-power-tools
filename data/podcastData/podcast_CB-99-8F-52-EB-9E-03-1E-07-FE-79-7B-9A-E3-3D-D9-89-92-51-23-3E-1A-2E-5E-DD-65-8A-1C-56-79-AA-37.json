These individuals build trust with their teams, challenge ideas respectfully, and maintain transparency about their concerns. Great POs actively seek feedback, clearly communicate the customer\u2019s voice, and leverage tools like <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/jobs-to-be-done/\"> Jobs To Be Done</a>  to align features with the company\u2019s strategy. Inviting customers to share their experiences with the team ensures that development stays user-focused and relevant.</p>   The Bad Product Owner: The Anti-Pattern of Control In The PO Role <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In contrast, Gosia describes a Product Owner who undermined team trust by changing estimation figures without the team\u2019s knowledge. During a meeting focused on affinity estimation for an upcoming release, the PO erased the team\u2019s work and provided altered estimates to the business. This action broke trust and disenfranchised the team, showcasing an anti-pattern where the PO assumes control rather than fostering team ownership. Such behavior can lead to decreased morale and a lack of transparency.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How do you ensure your actions as a Product Owner build trust and foster collaboration within your team?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
