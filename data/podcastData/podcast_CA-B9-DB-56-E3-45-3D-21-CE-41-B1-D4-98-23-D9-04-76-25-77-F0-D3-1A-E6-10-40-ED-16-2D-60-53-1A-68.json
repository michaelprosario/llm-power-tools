    "Description": "<p>Kinko\u2019s copy shops were once so ubiquitous that the name became a kind of shorthand for photocopying. Paul Orfalea started the first shop in 1970 in a tiny converted hamburger stand&nbsp;near UC Santa Barbara, called it Kinko\u2019s after his childhood nickname, and eventually grew it into a sprawling global chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than relying on a franchise model, Paul partnered with co-owners, which often made it hard to keep the business on track. Far-flung owners couldn\u2019t agree about the basics of logo design or the complexities of keeping stores open 24 hours. In 2004, Kinko\u2019s was acquired for $2.4 billion by FedEx, which eventually shed the name and transformed the shops into today\u2019s FedEx Office locations.</p><p>This episode was produced by Chis Maccini and edited by Neva Grant, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
