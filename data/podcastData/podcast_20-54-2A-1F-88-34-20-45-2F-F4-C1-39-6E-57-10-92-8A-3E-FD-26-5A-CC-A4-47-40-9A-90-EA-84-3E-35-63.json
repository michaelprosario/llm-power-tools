    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Frank Kane, an expert and top instructor in the field of big data, who also worked in Amazon for 10 years. You will learn how data science and big data have been different but are now converging into something that is very intertwined. You will hear about recommender systems such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering as well as other types of recommender systems and where this space of recommender systems is going. You will also hear about singular value decomposition or SVD model-based methods, deep learning and Amazon DSSTNE. And in the end, you will learn some very valuable tips on how to get hired by big companies like Amazon.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/265\">www.superdatascience.com/265</a></p>\n      ",
