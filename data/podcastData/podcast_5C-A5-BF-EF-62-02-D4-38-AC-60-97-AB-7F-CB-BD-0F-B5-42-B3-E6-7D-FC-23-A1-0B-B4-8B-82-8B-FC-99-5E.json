    "Description": "<p>The practice of \"shift left,\" which involves moving security concerns to the code level and increasing developers' responsibility for security, is facing a backlash, with both developers and security professionals expressing concerns. Peter Klimek, director of technology at Imperva, discusses the reasons behind this backlash in this episode.</p><p>Some organizations may have exhausted the benefits of shift left, while the main challenge for many isn't finding vulnerabilities but finding time to address them. Security attacks are now targeting business logic vulnerabilities rather than dependencies, which shift left tools are better at identifying. These business logic vulnerabilities are often tied to authorization decisions, making them harder to address through code-level tools. Additionally, attacks increasingly focus on the frontend, such as API development and cart attacks.</p><p>Klimek emphasizes the need for development and security teams to collaborate and advocates for using DORA metrics to assess the impact of security efforts on the development pipeline. Some organizations may reach a point where the tools added to the development lifecycle become counterproductive, he notes. DORA metrics can help determine when this occurs and provide valuable insights for security teams.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Developer Security and Imperva:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/why-your-apis-arent-safe-and-what-to-do-about-it/\">Why Your APIs Aren\u2019t Safe \u2014 and What to Do about It</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/what-developers-need-to-know-about-business-logic-attacks/\">What Developers Need to Know about Business Logic Attacks</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/are-your-development-practices-introducing-api-security-risks/\">Are Your Development Practices Introducing API Security Risks?</a></p>\n",
