    "Description": "<p>What do you think of when you hear economist? If you are thinking dry, boring, or not funny - then you absolutely should tune in and hear Dr. Sean Snaith shared his forecast for 2024 and 2030. I have been a fan of Dr. Snaith (and he is okay with calling him Sean) for over 10 years. I get the forecasts that are put out by UCF Institute of Economic Forecasting of which he is the director. I asked him what he forecasts for 2024? The world is still working on getting out of the COVID 19 disruption. The economy will slow down and consumers in the US have faced a decline in what money can purchase in previous years before COVID. Labor market is strong right now as consumers are using credit cards. This overall impact on the economy is spending will impact individuals and families if they continue to use credit cards to pay their bills. Checks and balances folks, think how we as humans have unlimited wants vs. limited needs. Decisions have to be made and if resources are scarce. Best mentoring advice shared - It is impossible to know the future. The future is not your final step. There is an opportunity cost with every choice. You have no idea where your future will take you. You can do any job for a period of time as long as you know that it is not forever.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.\u00a0\u00a0 The Intern Whisperer Podcast\u00a0is brought to you by\u00a0Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
