Reorgs over!'</p><p>How do you know it's successful? 'The changes are made in Workday. We sent the email. The reorg therefore is successful.'</p><p>No, it is not!

You do not know if the organ will be accepted.</p><p>- Mike Tria \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/miketria/\"><strong>MIKE TRIA</strong></a></h2><p>Mike Tria is the Head of Engineering for Platform at Atlassian.
