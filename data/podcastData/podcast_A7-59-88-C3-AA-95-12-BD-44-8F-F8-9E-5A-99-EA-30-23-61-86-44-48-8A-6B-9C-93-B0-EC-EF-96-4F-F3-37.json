The problem is that the modern-day world has a lot of stimulus and input that can throw us into that survival state, that fight flight freeze state very easily. So if you understand that that's what's happening, that we have all these patterns and they're mostly unconscious or barely conscious, then you start to think, \u2018Well, okay\u2026 What are the patterns that are serving me and what are the patterns that aren't?'\"</p><p>- Luther Kitahata\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Our in-person conference <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">ELC Annual</a> returns 10/27-28!</strong></h2><p>Learn from 60+ of the best engineering leaders in the industry / Critical insights on leadership, career and technology / Plus tons of experiences optimized for deep conversations & meaningful connections - all to help you build your support network!</p><p><strong><i>Don't miss out on being part of the biggest celebration of engineering leadership of the year!</i></strong></p><h3>Grab your ticket HERE: <strong><a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">sfelc.com/annual2022</a></strong></h3><hr /><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Luther\u2019s journey from eng leader to executive coach (02:33)</li><li>The relationship dynamics between executive coach & fractional CTO (4:58)</li><li>Using Enneagram results to assess eng leader\u2019s response to challenges (6:16)</li><li>Why you should be self-aware of your personality type (8:54)</li><li>How to coach eng leaders to talk in ways that others will listen (10:58)</li><li>Mindfulness techniques to foster a state of empathy & curiosity (12:32)</li><li>What unconscious traits & patterns hold eng leaders back at work (15:42)</li><li>How to recognize & address unconscious patterns (20:03)</li><li>Tools to help you uncover areas where you experience resistance (21:43)</li><li>Overcoming unconscious patterns by identifying your tendencies (22:49)</li><li>Shift from the comfort zone to the growth zone (25:28)</li><li>How to transition away from the high-stress zone (27:38)</li><li>Transformative leadership starts with self-awareness & a growth mindset (30:10)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (33:56)</li><li>Luther\u2019s method for tackling to-do lists with tools like Trello (35:51)</li><li>Rapid fire questions continued (38:38)</li></ul>\n",
