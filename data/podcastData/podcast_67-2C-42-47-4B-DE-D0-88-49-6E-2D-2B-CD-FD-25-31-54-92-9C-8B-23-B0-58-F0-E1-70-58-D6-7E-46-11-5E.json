    "Description": "<p>Bernd R\u00fccker, who has contributed to multiple open source workflow management projects, discusses orchestrating microservices with workflow management.\u00a0 As distributed systems evolve into a family of microservices that must handle long-running stateful processes with time-dependent actions, events, multiple paths through the system, and complex rollbacks, the workflow management model provides a way to ensure clear modeling, correctness, and separation of concerns.\u00a0\u00a0 R\u00fccker recommends a federated model in which each microservice is paired with its own workflow to handle retries and other policies and failure modes around that service.\u00a0 Robert Blumen spoke with R\u00fccker about microservice architecture, event-driven systems, long-running stateful processes versus synchronous request/response, event handling, time-outs, and handling exceptional conditions with compensating transactions. R\u00fccker compares the choreography versus orchestration models for collaboration and discusses why orchestration provides a better separation of concerns.\u00a0 The discussion delves into the implementation of workflow management systems including persistence, scaling, event handling, timers and scheduling, and similarities to CQRS.\u00a0 The discussion wraps up with monitoring and visualization.</p>",
