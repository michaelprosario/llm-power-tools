    "Description": "<p>Today I'm talking with Sasha Sheng. She's a software engineer who worked at Yahoo and at Facebook. During her 9 years working at big tech companies in San Francisco, she worked on mobile apps and AI systems.</p> <p>Sasha grew up in rural China, and was the first person in her family to attend university. She studied hard and was able to get into one of China's most competitive schools. She was able to move to the US and finish out her Mechanical Engineering degree at University of Michigan.</p> <p>When Sasha got laid off 8 months ago, she hit the ground running. She immersed herself in learning the new wave of AI tools. And she applied those new skills at hackathons, winning several competitive events.</p> <p>I caught up with Sasha to hear her thoughts on AI engineering, AI safety, and how we can get more women into tech.</p> <p>If you dig this podcast, be sure to leave us a review.
