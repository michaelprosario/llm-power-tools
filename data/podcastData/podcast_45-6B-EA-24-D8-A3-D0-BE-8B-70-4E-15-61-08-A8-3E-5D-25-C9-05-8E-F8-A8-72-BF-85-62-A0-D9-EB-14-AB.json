    "Description": "\n        <p>Collaboration is the new competition: that was French entrepreneur Lucie Basch\u2019s philosophy when she approached a group of Danish founders who happened to be working on a similar food waste reduction app.&nbsp;</p><p>Before long, Lucie and her new co-founders joined forces to create Too Good To Go, an app that enables restaurants and grocery stores to sell leftover items in \u2018surprise bags\u2019 at a significantly reduced price. Since launching in 2016, Too Good To Go has raised over $30 million dollars and has expanded to 17 countries, including the U.S.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Lucie talks with Guy about her company\u2019s work to leverage the \u2018horizontal power\u2019 of consumers to collectively chip away at global food waste. She also discusses the emergence of social enterprises like hers, that fill the gap between charitable and purely profit-driven organizations.</p><p>This episode was produced by Sam Paulson, with music by Sam Paulson and Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by John Isabella, with research help from Lauren Landau Einhorn.</p><p>Our audio engineer was Neal Rauch.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, and email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hibt@id.wondery.com</a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
