    "Description": "<p>Shadi Rostami, SVP of Engineering @ Amplitude, joins us to discuss key insights and strategies to increase your engineering orgs capacity to win in an economic downturn. We cover cultivating a founder\u2019s mindset and increasing product ownership in engineering. Plus prioritization strategies, determining where to invest resources, and shifting your team\u2019s perspective from skepticism to optimism.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadi-rostami-b6a636/\"><strong>SHADI ROSTAMI</strong></a></h2><p>Shadi Rostami is SVP of engineering at Amplitude. She is a passionate, seasoned technology leader and architect experienced in building and managing highly proficient engineering teams. Prior to Amplitude, she was VP of Engineering at Palo Alto Networks. She has innovated and delivered several product lines and services specializing in distributed systems, cloud computing, big data, machine learning, and security. She has a Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of British Columbia and a <a href=\"http://b.sc/\">B.Sc</a>. from Sharif University of Technology. Shadi has published several peer-reviewed conference articles and journals as well as several patents.</p><blockquote><p>\"Many, many years ago, I went to my VP and I asked him, \u2018Rajiv, I don't know, shall I do A or B?\u2019 And he told me, \u2018if it was your own money and your own company, which decision you would've made?\u2019 I said, \u2018I'll do A,\u2019 he says, \u2018then you know the answer. You don't need to come and ask me. Right? Put your founder hat on and tell me what decision we should be making.\u2019 Shall we do A or shall we do B? That is the ultimate sense of ownership.\u201d<br /><br />- Shadi Rostami\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Check out our friends and sponsor,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/sfelc/Jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a></h2><p>To learn more about Jellyfish and how they can help you increase engineering satisfaction and create happier, higher-performing engineering teams.</p><h3><strong>Learn more at</strong> <a href=\"http://jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish.co/elc</strong></a></h3><h3><br /><br />Join us for one of our in-person community events!</h3><p>That's right!
