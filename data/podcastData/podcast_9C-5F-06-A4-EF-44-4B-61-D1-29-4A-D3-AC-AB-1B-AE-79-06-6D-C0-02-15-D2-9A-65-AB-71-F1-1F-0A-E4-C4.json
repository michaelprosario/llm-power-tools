    "Description": "\n        <p>Businesses put a lot of energy into the chase\u2014you know, wooing and winning over potential customers with emails, paid ads and fancy landing pages. They work hard toward that sweet moment of victory when their customers finally decide to purchase. But then what? That\u2019s where a lot of businesses fall short. They\u2019re really good at acquiring customers, but not so good at keeping them and making them come back for more. Sound like you? You\u2019re in luck. Customer service pro and co-founder of Gravy, Casey Graham, gives us the inside scoop on what really makes customers stick around: doing unscalable things. No, seriously. He deep dives into how getting personal (and going above and beyond) for just one paying customer can help you reach, and keep, thousands more.</p> \u00a0  <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3q0KPaS\">Gravy's website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/33aC3gH\">UserTesting\u2019s website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2J94oxb\">FullStory's website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3m5Xpn1\">EveryDollar budgeting app</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3m3G8Ll\">Gravy Core Values - Does &amp; Doesn't Mean PDF</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2XIHfmJ\">How to Create Core Values</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/36ZDz6E\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
