Chris talks to the boys about System Center Service Manager, an IT Service Desk application recently added to System Center. Service Manager is the front line application for doing problem support, routine maintenance, routine workflow processes, and so on. Chris discusses how Service Manager becomes a hub for the other System Center components, making it easier to have a clear picture of what's going on with your system and what to work on next.
