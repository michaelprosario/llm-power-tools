    "Description": "<p>Melissa Raguet-Schofield @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/cloth_mother\">cloth_mother</a> is a Mom of a dyslexic. Today, we travel into the heart of a Mom of a child who struggles. What better motivation can we have as teachers than to empathize with those in our classroom who struggle? As a Mom of a dyslexic also, I hope you'll hear our heart for great teaching.</p> <p>Read the show notes at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e76\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e76</a> about 5 hours after this show goes live on iTunes.
