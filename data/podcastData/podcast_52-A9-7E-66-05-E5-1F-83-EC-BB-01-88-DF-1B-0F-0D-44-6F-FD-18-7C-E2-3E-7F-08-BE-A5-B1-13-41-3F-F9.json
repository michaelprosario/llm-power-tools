    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Stephen Welch, a computer vision and neural networks expert who will share a ton of information about the space of self-driving cars. You will learn about self-driving cars starting from the history of neural networks and how that was associated with self-driving cars from the '60s, '70s, '80s and all the way until now. You'll also learn about autonomous driving and the three components in the neural networks related to autonomous driving and what they are and how they work. You will find out about the five different levels of autonomous driving and what to expect in the next 10-20 years. You will hear a case study of how machine learning can be applied to historically older industries and you will also hear some very valuable career advice.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/259\">www.superdatascience.com/259</a></p>\n      ",
