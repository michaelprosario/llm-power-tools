    "Description": "<p>How would your organization report a data breach? Richard talks to Troy Hunt about his experiences with Have I Been Pwned and some good and not-so-good breach reporting. Troy talks about the importance of planning - making decisions about how to report is hard to do when you're under stress. And who do you report to? Are there regulatory requirements? What about your customers? Most people want to know if the data they entrusted to you has been stolen. And if you did want to contact every customer involved in a breach, how would you do that? This is a conversation for the C-suite, but you can start it!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a></li><li><a href=\"https://securitytxt.org/\">security.txt</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/beg-bounties/\">Beg Bounty</a></li></ul><p>Recorded July 17, 2023</p>\n",
