    "Description": "<p>ViAs we start this year, each of us is in different circumstances. I rebel against anyone with a \"one size fits all\" plan that works for everybody. Each of us has a different approach to life and planning. As I do my planning, I spend time learning from others. You can also plan your year in a new way as I share what I do. Over the past twenty years, I've created an annual planning system that works well for me. For the first time, I've put together a podcast sharing how I plan my year, along with some free forms you can use to plan your year. In this podcast, I include 28+ questions I ask myself each year. How I used two one-page forms to review last year, and I plan to change everything this year. A \"time budgeting\" spreadsheet that helps me make a big-picture time budget for the year. I also describe how I modify and improve my plan for the year as I grapple with life's hard questions. You can download these forms at <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/annualplan/\">www.coolcatteacher.com/annualplan</a>. I will also send these to subscribers in my following newsletter after the release of this show.</p> <p>Show Sponsor: Edge U Badges - <a href= \"https://www.forward-edge.net/edgeubadges/\">Edge U Badges</a> from Forward Edge is a fantastic micro credentialing program for teachers, administrators, and school staff. In this program, you can earn contact hours or graduate credit.</p> <p>With the ISTE Seal of Alignment, this program is approved by many districts as a flexible, personalized way for teachers to learn and grow. They will work with you to help your district accept your transcript for licensure renewal hours.</p> <p> Edge U Badges has former teachers review every single badge within 1-3 business days of submission, and no badge is ever denied without very specific feedback on what you can do to resubmit successfully or positive feedback on successful submissions.</p> <p>This is a program that I'm reviewing for my own renewal that comes up this year and I'm excited about their micro-credentialing system, which is why I'm recommending it to you!\u00a0</p> <p>Use the code COOLCAT for $20 off a premium account.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
