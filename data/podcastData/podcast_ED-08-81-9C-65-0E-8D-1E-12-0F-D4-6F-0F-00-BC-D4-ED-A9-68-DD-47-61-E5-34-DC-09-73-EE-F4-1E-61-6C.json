    "Description": "\n        <p>According to WhiteSpace at Work CEO <a href=\"http://www.whitespaceatwork.com\">Juliet Funt</a>, oftentimes the key to accomplishing more is to momentarily do less.

Juliet estimates that mindless busyness (such as pointless meetings, endless emails, redundant reports) costs businesses at least $1 million annually for every 50 employees. Her invaluable advice has helped teams at corporate giants like Nike, P&amp;G, and Pepsi find greater balance and improve overall performance\u2014and it can do the same for you.
