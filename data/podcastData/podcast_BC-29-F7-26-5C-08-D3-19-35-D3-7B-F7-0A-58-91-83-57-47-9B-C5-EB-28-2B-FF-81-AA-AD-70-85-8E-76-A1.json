    "Description": "<p>How do we accelerate learning? <a href= \"https://www2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/reopening-2.pdf\">The US Department of Education Roadmap for Reopening Safely</a> says that \"accelerated learning provides opportunities for students to learn at grade level rather than through tracking or remediation\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 Simply put, acceleration \u201cbuilds on what students know as a way to access new learning.\u201d (Roadmap p 18)</p> <p>Sponsor: Advancement Courses Thank you Advancement Courses for sponsoring today\u2019s show.

There is little doubt that many amazing kids are struggling to reengage with their learning progress. We cannot be content to let a generation of kids fall by the wayside. This is our watch and our duty and we have to work to do what is best. So, while some advocate acceleration for gifted kids, we need acceleration for all kids. It isn\u2019t about \u201ccatching up\u201d right now education is about reaching every child's potential. We would love to see this generation transcend and rise above the many challenges of our world. To get there, we must reengage. Acceleration research says it is a way to do that.</p> <p>Dr. Nancy Frey has researched Acceleration Research along with Douglas Fisher and shared their results in <a href= \"https://amzn.to/35PPFTu\">Rebound: A Playbook for Rebuilding Agency, Accelerating Learning Recovery, and Rethinking Schools.</a></p> <p>This episode is a companion to <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/rebound-how-do-schools-bounce-back-after-the-pandemic/\"> podcast episode 768</a>\u00a0with Douglas Fisher about schools that rebound.
