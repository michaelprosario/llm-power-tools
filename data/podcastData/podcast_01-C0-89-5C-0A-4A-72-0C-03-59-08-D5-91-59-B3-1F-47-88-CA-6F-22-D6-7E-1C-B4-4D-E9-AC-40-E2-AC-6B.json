Matthew founded and operated several small businesses after leaving the Naval service, and has successfully completed projects for Orlando-area theme parks and the University of Central Florida.</p>\n<p>Matthew is an expert in haptic gloves and the ability to feel the virtual world. Taking hardware solutions and programming this equipment so humans can experience something that can be dangerous but in a safe environment. Another example includes rocket launchers that allow regular people to blow something up in a virtual environment.\u00a0 He believes if people don\u2019t work to understand these new technologies they will be left behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tune in to hear more about the DoomsDay Clock that is set to 90 seconds to midnight.
