    "SourceUrl": null,
    "Description": "<p>Matanya Horowitz is not above dumpster diving in the name of innovation. His company, AMP Robotics, has developed robots to help waste management facilities better sort through incoming trash and separate recyclables. AMP has tested and refined their technology since launching in 2014, in part with materials that Matanya and his team personally picked from the garbage. Today, their robots can be found in hundreds of facilities worldwide, including some of their own.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Matanya talks about the business of recycling and his company\u2019s work to increase global recycling rates. Plus, Matanya explains how investors have come to see the value in garbage and dives into the reasons why so much recyclable material ends up in landfills.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Sam Paulson and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
