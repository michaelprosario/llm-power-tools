    "Description": "<p>Eiso Kant, CTO of poolside AI, discusses the company&#39;s approach to building frontier AI foundation models, particularly focused on software development. Their unique strategy is reinforcement learning from code execution feedback which is an important axis for scaling AI capabilities beyond just increasing model size or data volume. Kant predicts human-level AI in knowledge work could be achieved within 18-36 months, outlining poolside&#39;s vision to dramatically increase software development productivity and accessibility. </p><p><br></p><p>SPONSOR MESSAGES:</p><p>***</p><p>Tufa AI Labs is a brand new research lab in Zurich started by Benjamin Crouzier focussed on o-series style reasoning and AGI.
