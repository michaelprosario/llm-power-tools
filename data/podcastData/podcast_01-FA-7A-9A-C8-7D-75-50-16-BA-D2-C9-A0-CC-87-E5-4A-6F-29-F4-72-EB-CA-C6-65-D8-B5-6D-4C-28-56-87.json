    "Description": "<p>Koen Timmers @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/zelfstudie\">zelfstudie</a> is a teacher in Belgium. He has founded the Kakuma project where teachers are helping teach in refugee camp via Skype. In today's show, he talks about this project and his Human Differences project. This top 50 global teacher prize winner is inspiring. <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e132\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e132</a></p> <p>Today's sponsor is <a href= \"https://online.kidsdiscover.com/discover?utm_source=coolcatteacher&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=discovermap\"> Kid's Discover</a>.

This fun, visual tool lets students explore 150 different science and social studies units for elementary and middle school learners. And while they can explore a wide variety of topics from the US Constitution to Ecology and Ancient China, I also like that you can assign these non-fiction texts and three different lexiles to supplement what you're doing in the classroom.
