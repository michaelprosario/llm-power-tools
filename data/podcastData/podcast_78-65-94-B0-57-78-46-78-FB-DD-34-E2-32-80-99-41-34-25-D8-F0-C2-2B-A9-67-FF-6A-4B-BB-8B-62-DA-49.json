    "Description": "<p>Hardeep Gulati <a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/MyPowerSchool\">@MyPowerSchool</a>\u00a0CEO of PowerSchool shares about the Unified Classroom in this special ISTE episode. This unique approach combines a Student Information System (SIS), Learning Management System (LMS), Assessment Suite, and more into one classroom that shares data and has one login for teachers and students. This is a sponsored content episode just for the ISTE conference. Check out the full series!</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by Powerschool. I am so excited to be at ISTE with PowerSchool on Monday, June 26th, 2017 at 4 p.m. in room 225 A and B. I will be leading a panel discussion on the 5 teacher trends changing education. You will also want to come by PowerSchool\u2019s Classroom of the Future in 207A where they will be giving away Apple Watches, Microsoft Surfaces, and Amazon Echo.
