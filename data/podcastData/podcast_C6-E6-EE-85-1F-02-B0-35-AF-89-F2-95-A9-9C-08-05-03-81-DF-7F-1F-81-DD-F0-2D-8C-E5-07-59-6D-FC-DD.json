    "Description": "<p>Ash Hynie created CountrPT as to bridge the gap between manager perception and employee impact. Folks are tired, folks feel micro-managed, there's all this talk about return to office (RTO). Did we hire grown adults or not? What's the right way to manage technical teams, remote or other wise? How do we build relationships within our teams and with our managers where we can get direct and clear feedback about the needs of the business while still respecting that humans have feelings?</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://countrpt.io/\">https://countrpt.io/</a></li></ul>\n",
