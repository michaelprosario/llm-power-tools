    "SourceUrl": "https://www.hanselminutes.com/",
    "Description": "<p>It's 2021 and Scott's sons were asked to buy TI-83 calculators for their classes. Are there truly no better choices? Romain Goyet asked the same question...and did something about it. Numworks is the graphing calculator that makes everyone a math person. Open Source through and through, powerful, color, AND is allowed on major tests like the SAT, AP, PSAT and other College Board tests. It also runs a Python shell! How can such a wonderful thing exist? Scott finds out this week.</p><ul><li>https://www.numworks.com/</li></ul>\n",
