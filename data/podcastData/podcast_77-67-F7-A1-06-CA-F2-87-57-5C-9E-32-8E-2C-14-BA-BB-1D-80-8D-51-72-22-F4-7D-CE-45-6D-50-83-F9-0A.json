    "Description": "<p>After falling in love with the gelato shops of Buenos Aires, Josh Hochschuler came home to Dallas with a bold idea: bring authentic Argentine gelato to the U.S. He raised $600,000 from friends and family and opened a gelato shop called Talenti. The product was a hit - but the retail model wasn\u2019t. Faced with mounting losses, Josh shut down the store and moved into a warehouse to pivot to wholesale. With time, tenacity, and a now-iconic clear jar, Talenti became a national sensation, and in 2014, was acquired by Unilever. Today, it\u2019s the best-selling gelato brand in America.</p><p>This episode was produced by Casey Herman and edited by Kevin Leahy, with research by Kerry Thompson and music by Ramtin Arablouei. Our engineers were Patrick Murray and Robert Rodriguez.</p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter</em></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em></a>.
