    "Description": "\n        In 1972, Maureen and Tony Wheeler bought a beat-up car and drove from London \"as far east as we could go.\" They wound up in Australia, by way of Afghanistan, India and Thailand. Their notes on how to travel on a shoestring became a book, which grew into Lonely Planet \u2014 the largest travel guide publisher in the world. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how 15-year-old Michael Mendicino, with help from his mom, took a teenage trend and turned it into a board game called Bottle Flip.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n      ",
