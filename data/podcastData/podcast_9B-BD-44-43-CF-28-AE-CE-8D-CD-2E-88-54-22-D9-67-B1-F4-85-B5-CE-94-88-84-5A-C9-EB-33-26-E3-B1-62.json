    "Description": "Alex Kallaway was working as a full-time developer, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He wanted a way to try new technologies and grow his coding skills outside of work. So he created #100DaysofCode, the hashtag-based challenge that\u2019s helped him incorporate coding into his daily routine. He talks about how he designed the challenge, the number of people who\u2019ve joined him, and the updates he\u2019s making for 2017. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
