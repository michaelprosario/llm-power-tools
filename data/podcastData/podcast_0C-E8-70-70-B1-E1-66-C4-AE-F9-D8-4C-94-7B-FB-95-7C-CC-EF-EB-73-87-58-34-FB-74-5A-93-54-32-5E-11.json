    "Description": "<p>In today\u2019s show, Barbara Blackburn shares about the concept of rigor in education. We discuss how rigor is not about making things harder for students, but about setting high expectations and providing support to help students achieve those expectations. Barbara also explores specific examples of rigor in math, literature, writing, science, and history, emphasizing the importance of going beyond the text and providing evidence to demonstrate understanding.We, as teachers, can focus on the process of learning and engage students in meaningful discussions and activities. Barbara also shares her website, which offers over 100 free resources for educators.(Included in the show notes.)</p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e832\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e832</a></p> <p>Chapters</p> <p>00:00 Introduction and Humility</p> <p>00:44 Understanding Rigor</p> <p>01:55 Rigor in Math</p> <p>05:15 Rigor in Literature and Writing</p> <p>13:39 Rigor in Science and History</p> <p>15:00 Conclusion and Resources</p>",
