    "SourceUrl": "https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e854",
    "Description": "<p>In this show, I sit down with Eric Sheninger, CEO of Aspire Change EDU and author of \"Disruptive Thinking in Our Classrooms.\" Together, we explore the evolving landscape of student engagement in 2024. Eric and I discuss how to truly engage students. First, Eric talks about moving from compliance to engagement and how that is crucial for student learning. He shares his relevance of thinking framework. Eric also shares his opinion about AI and how it can be a valuable tool but also what it is not and his concerns. He talks about the focus for principals and how they should provide feedback and the role of principal observations in schools.</p> <p>Show Notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e854\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e854</a></p> <p>Sponsor: Juicemind - https://www.juicemind.com/</p> <p>As I taught coding this year in AP Computer Science Principles, I found JuiceMind so useful. Not only do they have the team coding tools we educators need (since Replit was discontinued) but they have Kahoot-like games where students can write code as part of the quizzing process. Juicemind also works with many math courses. I love their tools for studying in my coding classes and highly recommend Juicemind.</p> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
