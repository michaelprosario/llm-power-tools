    "Description": "\n        Has this ever happened to you? You get in the car and pull out of the driveway, just like you do every day. Then it dawns on you: \u201cThis is Saturday!\u201d You\u2019re halfway to the office when you realize you were headed to the store. Oops. It\u2019s easy to drift along in the wrong direction. That happens in life. And it happens in business. That phenomenon is called the drift. Just like the current in a river, life has unseen forces that pull you along in a given direction. Lifestage, busyness, culture, obligations \u2014all of that forms a draft that pulls you forward, whether you realize it or not. If you\u2019re not careful, you can wake up to find that your business and personal life have drifted to a destination you never intended. We\u2019ll show you how to avoid that by living your life with intention. We share three simple, powerful questions that will help you avoid the drift and navigate against the subtle forces of busyness and distraction. You can live your life on purpose if you pause long enough to answer these three profound questions. We are super excited about this episode! Why? Because we know how much these concepts have improved our lives. Here\u2019s what we hope you\u2019ll do after listening. Schedule some time on your calendar right now, and commit to using that time to reflect on the three questions we\u2019ve shared with you. You\u2019ll be amazed at the clarity you gain, and the determination to stay on course toward your biggest goals. Shout Out!
