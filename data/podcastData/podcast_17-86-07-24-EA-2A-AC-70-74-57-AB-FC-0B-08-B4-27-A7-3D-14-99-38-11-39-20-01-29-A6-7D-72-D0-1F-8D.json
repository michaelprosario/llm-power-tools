    "Description": "<p>I have known <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelweiss1985/'>Michael Weiss</a> for quite some time through his day job with UCF Incubator as a manager over two incubator sites.\u00a0 What I didn\u2019t know is that he is an entrepreneur, graduated with hospitality as his field of study, and that he has quite a bit of knowledge and experience in the sports industry.\u00a0 When I asked him what his five words are that defined him, he shared that he likes to have fun. One of the short stories he shared was about a new minor league basketball team that he had a job with. He had the opportunity to come up with slogans and his idea was selected. The team was the Pitbulls, and the slogan that was a \u201cslam dunk\u201d (pun intended) was \"Meet the Pitbulls unleashed\".\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Michael is interesting because he works every day with startup founders and is a wealth of knowledge and demonstrates his desire to help others achieve greatness.\u00a0 His startup is Room Rite and he decided to launch when he identified a problem when planning a family reunion. He noticed there were very few hotels that offered affordable room rates. The hotels were overpriced and had little inventory.\u00a0 Michael wondered how often hotels have rooms that are not picked up during conferences.\u00a0 Taking you to the end of this first chapter of his startup journey. He won 4th place at the <a href='https://orlandoventureplan.com/'>Rollins College Venture Competition</a> and received an equity free $5,000 prize.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please tune in to hear his interview and learn more about what he thinks the hospitality industry will look like in 2030.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer. <a href='http://www.internwhisperer.podbean.com'>The Intern Whisperer Podcas</a>t is brought to you by <a href='https://www.e4c.tech/'>Employers 4 Change</a> - Increasing #Skills #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apply today to be an #Employer4Change that invests in #intern #talent and #employees.</p>\n<p>Want a break?
