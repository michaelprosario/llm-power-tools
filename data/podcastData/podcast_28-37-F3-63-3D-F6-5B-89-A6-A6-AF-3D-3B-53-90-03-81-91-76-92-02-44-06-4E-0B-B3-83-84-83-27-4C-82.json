    "Description": "<p>This week Connor Shorten, Yannic Kilcher and Tim Scarfe reacted to Yann LeCun's keynote speech at this year's ICLR conference which just passed. ICLR is the number two ML conference and was completely open this year, with all the sessions publicly accessible via the internet. Yann spent most of his talk speaking about self-supervised learning, Energy-based models (EBMs) and manifold learning. Don't worry if you hadn't heard of EBMs before, neither had we!</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!
