    "Description": "<p>This episode delves into Apache Flink, a versatile platform for executing both batch and real-time streaming data analysis tasks. This session marks the beginning of a three-part series unveiling Amazon Web Services' (AWS) new managed service built on Flink. Future episodes will explore this service in detail and examine customer experiences.</p><p>The podcast features insights from Danny Cranmer, a principal engineer at AWS and an Apache Flink PMC and Committer, along with Hong Teoh, a software development engineer at AWS.</p><p>Flink stands out as a high-level framework for defining data analytics jobs, accommodating both batch and streaming data sets. It offers APIs for building analysis jobs in various languages, including Java, Python, and SQL. Flink also provides a distributed job execution engine with fault tolerance and horizontal scaling capabilities.</p><p>One prominent use case is Extract-Transform-Load (ETL), where raw data is swiftly processed for specific workloads. Flink excels in delivering low-latency transformations for unbounded data streams. Additionally, Flink supports event-driven applications, responding immediately to triggers such as user requests for weather data.</p><p>Flink ensures exactly-once processing, critical for scenarios like financial transactions. It employs checkpoints to maintain data integrity in case of node failures.</p><p>The podcast also touches on AWS's role in supporting the open-source Flink project and the future outlook for this powerful data processing framework.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Apache Flink:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/3-reasons-why-you-need-apache-flink-for-stream-processing/\">3 Reasons Why You Need Apache Flink for Stream Processing</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/apache-flink-for-unbounded-data-streams/\">Apache Flink for Unbounded Data Streams</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/8-real-time-data-best-practices/\">8 Real-Time Data Best Practices</a></p>\n",
