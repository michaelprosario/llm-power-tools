A prodigious young man too, Wolfram earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the California Institute of Technology by the age of 20. He became the youngest recipient of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship at the age of 21.\n\nWolfram&#39;s groundbreaking computational tool, Mathematica, was launched in 1988 and has become a cornerstone for researchers and innovators worldwide. In 2002, he published &quot;A New Kind of Science,&quot; a paradigm-shifting work that explores the foundations of science through the lens of computational systems.\n\nIn 2009, Wolfram created Wolfram Alpha, a computational knowledge engine utilized by millions of users worldwide. His current focus is on the Wolfram Language, a powerful programming language designed to democratize access to cutting-edge technology.\n\nWolfram&#39;s numerous accolades include honorary doctorates and fellowships from prestigious institutions. As an influential thinker, Dr. Wolfram has dedicated his life to unraveling the mysteries of the universe and making computation accessible to all.\n\nFirst of all... we have an announcement to make, you heard it FIRST here on MLST! ....\n\nIntro [00:00:00]\nBig announcement!
