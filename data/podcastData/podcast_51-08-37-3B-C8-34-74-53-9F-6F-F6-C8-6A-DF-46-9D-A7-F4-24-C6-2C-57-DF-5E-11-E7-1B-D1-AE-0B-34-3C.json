    "Description": "<p>The Linux Foundation's Open Source Security Foundation (OSSF) is addressing the challenge of timely software component updates to prevent security vulnerabilities like Log4J. In an interview with Alex Williams of The New Stack at the Open Source Summit in Vancouver, Omkhar Arasaratnam, the new general manager of OSSF, and Brian Behlendorf, CTO of OSSF, discuss the importance of making software secure from the start and the need for rapid response when vulnerabilities occur.\u00a0</p><p>In this conversation, they highlight the significance of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), which provide a complete list of software components and supply chain relationships. SBOMs offer data that can aid decision-making and enable reputation tracking of repositories. The interview also touches on the issues with package managers and the quantification of software vulnerability risks. Overall, the goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software component updates and leverage data to enhance security in enterprise and production environments.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/creating-a-minimum-elements-sbom-document-in-5-minutes/\" target=\"_blank\">Creating a 'Minimum Elements' SBOM Document in 5 Minutes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/enhance-your-sbom-success-with-slsa/\" target=\"_blank\">Enhance Your SBOM Success with SLSA</a></p>\n",
