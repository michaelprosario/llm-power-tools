    "Description": "<p>Steve Summers speaks with SE Radio host\u00a0<a class=\"css-1rn59kg\" title= \"https://se-radio.net/team/sam-taggart/\" href= \"https://se-radio.net/team/sam-taggart/\" data-testid= \"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark=\"true\">Sam Taggart</a> about securing test and measurement equipment. They start by differentiating between IT and OT (Operational Technology) and then discuss the threat model and how security has evolved in the OT space, including a look some of the key drivers. They then examine security challenges associated with a specific device called a CompactRIO, which combines a Linux real-time CPU with a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and some analog hardware for capturing signals and interacting with real-world devices.</p> <p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name= \"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\" data-pm-slice= \"1 1 []\">Brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IEEE Computer Society</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.computer.org/software\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">IEEE Software magazine</a>.</p>",
