    "Description": "<p>How does a PowerApp become a fully-fledged software application? Richard chats with Luise Freese about her experience of taking a PowerApp built by an individual through the \"onboarding process\" of becoming a complete software application, including requirements, tests, deployment pipeline, security, user training, and more. It's easy to create a prototype of an application with PowerApps, but once you move beyond the basics, there's a significant amount of work that's essential to the long-term health of the app. Luise discusses how often PowerApps utilizes \"free\" data sources, such as SharePoint lists, rather than the underlying datasets that require a license. This hinders performance and reliability; it's better to work with the right APIs and data sources. It's also an accomplishment, as what started as an individual's automation is now a part of the suite of applications that a company depends on!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-powerapps\">Power Apps and Power Automate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.m365princess.com/blogs/decathlon/\">Luise's Blog Post</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Microsoft Power Platform Center of Excellence Starter Kit</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/azuread?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Entra ID for Power Apps</a></li></ul><p>Recorded June 27, 2025</p>\n",
