    "Description": "<p>Maybe you don't think GameStop is a tech story, but rest assured, the screenwriting duo behind The Social Network and \u00a021 will inject plenty of nerdery into the Hollywood version.</p><p>Sara is eager to share the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html\">history of CSS</a>, and all the ways it has let her down.</p><p>We dig into a wise act of self-prersevation from Ben B Johnson. As <a href=\"https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream#open-source-not-open-contribution\">he writes</a>: \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html\">\"Similar to SQLite</a>, Litestream is open source but closed to contributions. This keeps the code base free of proprietary or licensed code but it also helps me continue to maintain and build Litestream.</p><p>As the author of <a href=\"https://github.com/boltdb/bolt\">BoltDB</a>, I found that accepting and maintaining third party patches contributed to my burn out and I eventually archived the project. Writing databases & low-level replication tools involves nuance and simple one line changes can have profound and unexpected changes in correctness and performance. Small contributions typically required hours of my time to properly test and validate them.</p><p>I am grateful for community involvement, bug reports, & feature requests. I do not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, I've made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for my own mental health and long term viability of the project.\"</p><p>Hurray for new approaches that don't ignore personal wellbeing.\u00a0</p><p>Today's lifeboat badge winner is Quinn, who explained: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35688126/replace-string-in-file-with-using-regular-expressions/35688301#35688301\">How to replace a string in a file using regular expressions</a></p>\n",
