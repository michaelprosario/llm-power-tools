    "Description": "<p>What's it like to build a tool for SQL DBAs? Richard chats with Kendra Little about her role at Red Gate being a product manager for the SQL DevOps tools. Kendra talks about moving to the UK to be closer to the main offices of Red Gate - just in time for pandemic lockdowns to start. The conversation digs into the various strategies around including databases in a DevOps approach, and how tooling can help. Kendra also explores the challenges of making the right thing, working with the team effectively through the pandemic, and software development teams have evolved in this strange time in history.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-compare/\">SQL Compare</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-ver15\">SQL Server Data Tools</a></li></ul>\n",
