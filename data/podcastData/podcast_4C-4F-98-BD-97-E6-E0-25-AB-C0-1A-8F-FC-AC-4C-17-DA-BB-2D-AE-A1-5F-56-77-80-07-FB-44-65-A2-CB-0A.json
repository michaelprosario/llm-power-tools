    "Description": "<p>Can deploying software and updates enable a hack? Richard chats with Mikael Nystr\u00f6m about doing secure deployments - and this leads to a conversation about how modern hackers are exploiting systems today. Modern hackers can break into machines, but security restrictions limit their ability to exploit - until an administrator logs into the machine. Mikael talks about limiting your use of super-user accounts, including for deployment - and keeping your systems difficult for hackers to exploit!</p>\n",
