    "Description": "<p>What's your Productivity Score? Richard talks to Ulrika Hedlund about productivity in 2021 - the impact of the pandemic on work, and how IT can help. Ulrika discusses the rush to work remotely and the move into the cloud, including Microsoft 365. But the move is not enough - you have to train and learn how to use the new tools available. The conversation focuses on the etiquette of chat, email, video, and audio meetings - and the difference in formality between work and home uses! Ulrika also talks about the Productivity Score that M365 can provide to help IT understand how folks are using the technology so that they can provide support where needed.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\">Microsoft Teams</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/surface-hub-2\">Microsoft Surface Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/productivity-score/\">Microsoft Productivity Score</a></li><li><a href=\"https://storyals.com/\">Storyals</a></li></ul>\n",
