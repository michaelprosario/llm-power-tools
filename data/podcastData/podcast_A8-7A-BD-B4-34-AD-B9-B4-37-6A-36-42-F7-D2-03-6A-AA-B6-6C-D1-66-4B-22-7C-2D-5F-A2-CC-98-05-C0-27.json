    "Description": "<p>Self-care is a word thrown around a lot these days in education. In the real world of teaching, answers aren't always easy. In fact, as I release this episode, \"self-care\" is the reason I did not go to #ISTELive that is this week. I need to focus on my health. So, it is fitting that today I discuss the reality of teaching with another teaching veteran. We share how we have navigated the stresses and struggles of teaching as we seek to live a balanced life and do what matters. In addition to the podcast, I've included some inspiring poems, quotes, and a video from the day I learned to walk this past May. I, Vicki Davis (the show host) have made some mistakes in self-care in the past year, and open up about what I've learned from those mistakes and how I'm moving forward to teach better and take better care of myself.\u00a0</p> <p>My hope is by being open about my own struggles and by bringing in the research that this show and blog post will help all of us teachers take better care of ourselves. Right now, this topic is more important than any education technology I could be talking about. So, take care of yourselves, teachers, this one's for you.</p> <p>Sponsor: In today\u2019s show, you learned more about taking care of yourself. You also learned about many courses from Advancement Courses, which has over 280 online graduate-level PD courses in not only self-care but topics for every grade level and subject area.
