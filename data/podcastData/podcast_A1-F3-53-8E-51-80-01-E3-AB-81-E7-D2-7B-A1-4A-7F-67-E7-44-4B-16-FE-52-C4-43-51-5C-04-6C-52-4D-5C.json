    "Description": "<p>The amount of data created has doubled every year, presenting a host of challenges for organizations: security and privacy issues for starters, but also storage costs. What situations call for that data move to decentralized cloud storage rather than on-prem or even a single public cloud storage setup? What are the advantages and challenges of a decentralized cloud storage solution for data, and how can those be navigated?</p><p>On this episode of <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/podcasts\">Makers</a>, the New Stack podcast, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengolub/\">Ben Golub</a>, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.storj.io/\">Storj</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.storj.io/author/krista-spriggs\">Krista Spriggs</a>, software engineering manager at the company, were joined by Alex Williams, founder and publisher of The New Stack, along with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-a-joslyn/\">Heather Joslyn</a>, TNS\u2019 features editor.
