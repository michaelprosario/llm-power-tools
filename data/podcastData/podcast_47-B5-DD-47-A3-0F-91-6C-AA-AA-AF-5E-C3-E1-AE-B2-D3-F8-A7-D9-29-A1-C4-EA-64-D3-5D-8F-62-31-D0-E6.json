    "Description": "<p>Autistic children can struggle with unfamiliar places. However, one teacher of the year has found a way to help improve traveling experiences for autistic children and their families. Brett Bigham has created a way to use books to help special needs and young children prepare to go to new places. Learn about this technique and how to help children travel who may have fears. You can even make books for kids (or some older students might be able to as well.) What a life-changing concept! Ability books for those with special needs.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e208\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e208</a></p>",
