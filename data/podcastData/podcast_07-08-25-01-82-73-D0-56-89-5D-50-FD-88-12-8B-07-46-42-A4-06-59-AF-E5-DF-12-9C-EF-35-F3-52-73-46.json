    "Description": "<p>There\u2019s no doubt that the cognitive load developers are facing is seemingly endlessly increasing. Microservices and open source have aggravated the situation, where it\u2019s nearly impossible for one developer to get up to speed with any codebase. This makes onboarding extra challenging, and contributes to about <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/this-cant-be-normal-the-tech-industry-after-a-year-of-burnout/\">two-thirds of tech workers experiencing burnout</a>. <a href=\"https://www.codesee.io/\">CodeSee</a> looks to help developers get up to speed faster by visualizing a codebase in just a few clicks.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneaLeven\">Shanea Leven</a>, CEO and founder of CodeSee, sat down with TNS writer, Jennifer Riggins, on this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast to discuss workload complexity, work-life balance, and hiring/retaining best practices within the DevOps community.</p>\n",
