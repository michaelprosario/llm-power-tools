    "Description": "\n        <p>We live in a society of \"more is better\". The argument goes that a big business is obviously better than a small one. But, is that actually true? What if you could actually achieve more with less? </p><p>On this episode, Joel Miller speaks with Leidy Klotz about his book, <em>Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less.</em> Leidy shares the subtle yet powerful biological and psychological reasons behind our 'addition bias' and how we can recalibrate our mindsets to view subtraction as an equally valid \u2013 and often better \u2013 choice. The conversation culminates in Leidy's description of the 'meeting doomsday' tactic - a powerful strategy that could free up hours on your calendar every week.</p><p>In this episode, you'll learn:</p><ul><li>How subtraction can often be more beneficial than addition, especially in small business environments.</li><li>The need to shift from the common assumption that more is always better, and how to build processes that incorporate subtraction as a strategic choice.</li><li>The biological and psychological influences driving our \"addition bias\"</li></ul><p><br></p><p>To learn more about Dr. Klotz and his book, visit <a href=\"https://www.leidyklotz.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.leidyklotz.com/</a>.</p><p>For more podcasts, visit\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.businessaccelerator.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.businessaccelerator.com/podcast</a>.</p><p><strong>The Business Accelerator podcast is a reflection of the values and processes inside the BusinessAccelerator coaching program.
