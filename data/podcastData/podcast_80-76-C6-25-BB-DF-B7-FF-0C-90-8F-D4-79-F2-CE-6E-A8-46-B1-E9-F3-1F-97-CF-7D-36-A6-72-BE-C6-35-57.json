    "Description": "\n        <p>The singularity could soon be upon us. The PESTLE framework, developed by this episode\u2019s guest Daniel Hulme, expresses not one but six types of singularity that could occur: political, environmental, social, technological, legal and economic. Jon Krohn and Daniel Hulme discuss how each of these singularities could bring good to the world, aligning with human interests and pushing forward progress. They also talk about neuromorphic computing, machine consciousness, and applying AI at work.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://go.aws/3zWS0au\">AWS Inferentia</a> and <a href=\"https://go.aws/3ycV6K0\">AWS Trainium</a>, and by <a href=\"https://www.gurobi.com/personas/optimization-for-data-scientists\">Gurobi</a>, the Decision Intelligence Leader.
