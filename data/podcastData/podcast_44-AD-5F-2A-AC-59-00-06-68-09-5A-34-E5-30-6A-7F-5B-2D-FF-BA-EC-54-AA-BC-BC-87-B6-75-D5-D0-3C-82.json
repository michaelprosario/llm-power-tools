    "Description": "<p>In today's episode, we dive into the transformative potential of AI in promoting equity in education with Victoria Thompson, one of ISTE's 2023 \"Top 20 to Watch\" and author of the book Elevate Equity in EdTech. While many educators are understandably concerned about AI's potential biases, Victoria shares her perspective on how AI tools like speech-to-text, translators, and others are leveling the playing field in classrooms in remarkable ways. Victoria works to give you some actionable insights on introducing AI, how we're already using it, and ways we can understand how AI can be used positively. She also encourages us to look at AI startups and certifications with a critical eye and shares what she looks for in a certification program.</p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e859\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e859</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Sponsor: EVERFI from Blackbaud</p> <p>Do you want to equip your students for success in both their careers and personal lives, but find yourself racing against the clock?
