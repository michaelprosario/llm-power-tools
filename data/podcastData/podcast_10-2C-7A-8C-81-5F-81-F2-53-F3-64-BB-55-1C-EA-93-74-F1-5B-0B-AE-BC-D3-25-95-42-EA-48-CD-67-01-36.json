    "Description": "<p>J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, the father of generative AI, challenges current AI narratives, revealing that early deep learning work is in his opinion misattributed, where it actually originated in Ukraine and Japan. He discusses his early work on linear transformers and artificial curiosity which preceded modern developments, shares his expansive vision of AI colonising space, and explains his groundbreaking 1991 consciousness model. Schmidhuber dismisses fears of human-AI conflict, arguing that superintelligent AI scientists will be fascinated by their own origins and motivated to protect life rather than harm it, while being more interested in other superintelligent AI and in cosmic expansion than earthly matters. He offers unique insights into how humans and AI might coexist.\n\nThis was the long-awaited second, unreleased part of our interview we filmed last time. \n\nSPONSOR MESSAGES:\n***\nCentML offers competitive pricing for GenAI model deployment, with flexible options to suit a wide range of models, from small to large-scale deployments. \nhttps://centml.ai/pricing/\n\nTufa AI Labs is a brand new research lab in Zurich started by Benjamin Crouzier focussed on o-series style reasoning and AGI.
