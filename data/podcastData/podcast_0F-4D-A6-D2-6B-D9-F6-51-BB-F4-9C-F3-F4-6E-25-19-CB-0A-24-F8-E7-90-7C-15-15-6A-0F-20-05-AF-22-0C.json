    "Description": "You've got a new job at a new company in a new industry. It's been a few weeks, and things feel a bit off. Maybe you were excluded from a meeting, or your boss isn't being supportive, or maybe you're worried about keeping that new job. What do you do? Who do you call for help?

She digs into some of common issues that folks run into, how the hotline works, and what the unique challenges are for those going into the tech industry.
