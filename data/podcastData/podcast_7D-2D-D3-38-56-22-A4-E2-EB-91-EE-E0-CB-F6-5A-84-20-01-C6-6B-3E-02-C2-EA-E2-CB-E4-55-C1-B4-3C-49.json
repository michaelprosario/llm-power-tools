    "Description": "<p>Karen Lirenman and Kristen Wideen have written the definitive book on using iPads in the elementary classroom, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2krdUgD\">Innovate with iPad: Lessons to Transform Learning in the Classroom</a>. In this episode, they share their favorite apps and the biggest mistake they made when getting started with iPads in their classrooms.</p> <p>The problem with iPads is there are so many apps and so many choices. It is easy for teachers to get overwhelmed and not know where to start. Even worse, some teachers just use them for \u201cgame day\u201d and miss the opportunity they have to do help students learn with them.</p> <p>Today\u2019s show will help settle the dust and bring clarity to iPads in the elementary classroom. I love their book, Innovate with iPad: Lessons to Transform Learning in the Classroom, so much that we bought it for every teacher at my school. And here\u2019s the most exciting thing!</p> <p>We\u2019re hosting a giveaway of this book in the next 24 hours! A full transcript of this show and the show notes are available at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast\">www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast</a> as well as details on this month\u2019s giveaway contest to win a MakerBot mini replicator 3D and Kristen and Karen\u2019s book!</p>",
