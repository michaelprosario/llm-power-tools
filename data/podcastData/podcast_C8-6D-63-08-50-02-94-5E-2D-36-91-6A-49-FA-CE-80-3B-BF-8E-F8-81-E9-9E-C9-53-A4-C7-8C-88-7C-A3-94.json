    "Description": "\n        <p>Leaders are achievers. But nobody bats 1.000. We all experience failure eventually. That can be discouraging\u2014even humiliating! That\u2019s why most of us react in one of two ways. Either we globalize our failure by thinking we won\u2019t <em>ever</em> succeed. Or we sweep the loss away quickly and forget it. </p> <p>But what if there was a better way to fail? </p> <p>Failure doesn\u2019t have to be fatal, and it should never be ignored. We know because we\u2019ve been there! </p> <p>Your failures can make you a better leader if you take the time to examine them non-defensively, learn some lessons, and then move on with confidence. Based on years of business experience, including our share of ups and downs, we\u2019ve identified six specific actions you can take to get every bit of value you can from an experience\u2014even failure. </p> <p>Here\u2019s a preview of this episode:</p> <ul> <li>The most recent failure we experienced, and what we learned from it.</li> <li>The obvious\u2014and <em>difficult</em>\u2014first step in learning from failure. </li> <li>How ignoring your own failure undermines your confidence.  </li> <li>How avoiding full responsibility for your failure compounds the effect. </li> <li>The most empowering action you can take after a failure. </li> <li>Healthy ways to mourn a failure.</li> <li>The downside of \u201cstaying strong\u201d all the time. </li> <li>Six questions that help you learn from failure.</li> <li>The \u201cKISS\u201d method for processing an experience (it\u2019s not what you think). </li> <li>The most important trait you need in order to avoid repeating a failure.</li> <li>The surprising and beneficial result of taking time to process failure.</li> <li>That day Michael <em>literally</em> got back up on the horse!</li> <li>How to keep failure from making your fearful in the future. </li> <li>The reason you can actually be <em>grateful</em> for a failure.</li> </ul> <p>Now that you know <em>how</em> to profit from failure, try this: apply these six steps to your most recent experience of failure. We\u2019re betting that\u2019ll help you avoid being stuck in the past, and gain the wisdom you need to achieve even greater things in the future. Give it a try!</p>  <p>TEXT A FRIEND</p> <p>If this episode strikes home with you,  why not text the link to a friend? Failure is a universal experience, and someone you know could probably benefit from this content. </p> <p>While you\u2019re at it, we\u2019d love to hear from you too. Would you leave a <a href=\"https://michaelhyatt.com/reviewit/\">review on iTunes</a>? Good, bad, or indifferent. We\u2019d love to hear what you think. We read all of your comments, and they really do help us make the show better!
