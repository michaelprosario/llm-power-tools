    "Description": "\n        <p>Entrepreneur and Quest Nutrition co-founder Tom Bilyeu isn\u2019t a doctor, but he has confidently diagnosed himself with a \u201csickness\u201d that has only one symptom: an intense need to matter. But if you ask him, it\u2019s a pretty good affliction to have. And considering that he helped grow Quest by 57,000% in only three years, we\u2019d say he\u2019s 100% right. Tune in as Tom breaks down the difference between ambition and drive and shares why pursuing your passion\u2014not a big payday\u2014is infinitely more rewarding in the long run.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3361QEO\">Impact Theory's website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/34oVwc1\"><em>Principles</em></a> by Ray Dalio</p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/36mF79w\">Impact Theory Comics</a></p> <p>Free download: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2LBtuon\">Chapter 1 of <em>EntreLeadership</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2q5DQTU\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
