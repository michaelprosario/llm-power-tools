    "Description": "<p>Heroku has open-sourced its Twelve-Factor App methodology, initially created in 2011 to help developers build portable, resilient cloud applications. Heroku CTO Gail Frederick announced this shift at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America, explaining the move aims to involve the community in modernizing the framework. While the methodology inspired a generation of cloud developers, certain factors are now outdated, such as the focus on logs as event streams. Frederick highlighted the need for updates to address current practices like telemetry and metrics visualization, reflecting the rise of OpenTelemetry.</p><p>The updated Twelve-Factor methodology will expand to accommodate modern cloud-native realities, such as deploying interconnected systems of apps with diverse backing services. Planned enhancements include supporting documents, reference architectures, and code examples illustrating the principles in action. Success will be measured by its applicability to use cases involving edge computing, IoT, serverless, and distributed systems. Heroku views this open-source effort as an opportunity to redefine best practices for the next era of cloud development.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Heroku:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-heroku-is-positioned-to-help-ops-engineers-in-the-genai-era/\">How Heroku Is Positioned To Help Ops Engineers in the GenAI Era</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-data-stack-journey-lessons-from-architecting-stacks-at-heroku-and-mattermost/\">The Data Stack Journey: Lessons from Architecting Stacks at Heroku and Mattermost</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
