    "Description": "In this episode we talk about the relationship between software architecture and the business. Based on his book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201775948/ref=pd_bxgy_text_1/102-8679361-5493744?v=glance&s=books&st=*\">Beyond Software Architecture</a> we discuss how things such as branding, licensing, updating or different deployment scenarios influence the technical architecture of a system. We also discuss issues such as portability that add a huge amount of complexity, although from a business perspective it often does not make much sense. In the second part of the interview we discuss how the technical team and the business team can improve the way they work together. We look at some of the games (such as <em>Buy a Feature</em> or <em>Give them a Hot Tub</em>) from his new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321437292/qid=1147394369/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/104-8195174-7443967?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\">Innovation Games</a>, which discusses how to use collaborative play to be more creative and innovative in product creation.",
