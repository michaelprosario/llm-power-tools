    "Description": "<p>How does data analytics fit into your business intelligence strategy? While at Ignite in Atlanta, Richard sat down with Jen Stirrup to discuss her experiences helping companies really take advantage of the data they have to understand how their businesses are doing, and what they could be doing better. The conversation starts out with a discussion on data warehousing, which is still valuable in this day and age. Jen talks about how the ETL process sometimes &quot;shaved off the corners&quot; of important data, and that new data analytics strategies are better at avoiding that behaviour. The discussion also turns to R and the statistical analysis approaches available today to really understand data. It's a brave new data world!</p>\n",
