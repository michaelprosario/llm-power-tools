    "Description": "<p>Have you moved through the fundamentals of Python, and are you now considering building a more extensive project or complete application? Where can you study the architecture of existing Python projects and learn best practices? Christopher Trudeau is back on the show this week, bringing another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>We discuss a set of resources that developers can study to learn how to structure projects. The collection was shared in a blog post titled &ldquo;Great Resources a Beginner Might Not Find So Easily.&rdquo; It includes a pair of books on the architecture of large software applications and another aimed at more modest projects.</p>\n<p>We consider when you should use lambda expressions in your Python code. These one-line expressions create anonymous functions. How do they differ from standard functions, and where is it appropriate to use them? </p>\n<p>We also share several other articles and projects from the Python community, including a couple of release announcements, an explanation of Python as a compiled language, a discussion covering the controversy about the recent Flask release, a project for writing less Selenium code, and a project to create ASCII art with Python.</p>\n<p>This week&rsquo;s episode is brought to you by Site24x7.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/solid-principles-python/\">Design and Guidance: Object-Oriented Programming in Python</a></p>\n<p>In this video course, you&rsquo;ll learn about the SOLID principles, which are five well-established standards for improving your object-oriented design in Python. By applying these principles, you can create object-oriented code that is more maintainable, extensible, scalable, and testable.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction </li>\n<li>00:02:50 &ndash; PyCon US 2024 Call for Proposals</li>\n<li>00:03:18 &ndash; Django 5.0 Beta 1 Released</li>\n<li>00:03:29 &ndash; Django security releases issued: 4.2.7, 4.1.13, and 3.2.23</li>\n<li>00:03:51 &ndash; The Ruff Formatter: Python&rsquo;s Fastest Formatter</li>\n<li>00:04:50 &ndash; What Are Lambda Expressions?</li>\n<li>00:12:01 &ndash; Sponsor: Site24x7.com</li>\n<li>00:12:56 &ndash; Python Is a Compiled Language</li>\n<li>00:16:01 &ndash; Great Resources a Beginner Might Not Find So Easily</li>\n<li>00:27:01 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:28:32 &ndash; We Have to Talk About Flask</li>\n<li>00:41:46 &ndash; selenium-python-helium: Write Less Selenium Code</li>\n<li>00:45:23 &ndash; pyfiglet: An implementation of figlet written in Python</li>\n<li>00:47:17 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>News:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pretalx.com/pyconus2024/\">PyCon US 2024 Call for Proposals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/oct/23/django-50-beta-1-released/\">Django 5.0 Beta 1 Released</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/nov/01/security-releases/\">Django security releases issued: 4.2.7, 4.1.13, and 3.2.23 | Weblog | Django</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/10/25/the-ruff-formatter-pythons-fastest-formatter/\">The Ruff Formatter: Python&rsquo;s Fastest Formatter</a> &ndash; You may have come across Ruff, a linter that&rsquo;s been on the scene for about a year.
