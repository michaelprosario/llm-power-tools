    "Description": "<p>In this New Stack Makers, Codiac aims to simplify app deployment on Kubernetes by offering a unified interface that minimizes complexity. Traditionally, Kubernetes is powerful but challenging for teams due to its intricate configurations and extensive manual coding. Co-founded by Ben Ghazi and Mark Freydl, Codiac provides engineers with infrastructure on demand, container management, and advanced software development life cycle (SDLC) tools, making Kubernetes more accessible.</p><p>Codiac\u2019s interface streamlines continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), reducing deployment steps to a single line of code within CI/CD pipelines. Developers can easily deploy, manage containers, and configure applications without mastering Kubernetes' esoteric syntax. Codiac also offers features like \"cabinets\" to organize assets across multi-cloud environments and enables repeatable processes through snapshots, making cluster management smoother.</p><p>For experienced engineers, Codiac alleviates the burden of manually managing YAML files and configuring multiple services. With ephemeral clusters and repeatable snapshots, Codiac supports scalable, reproducible development workflows, giving engineers a practical way to manage applications and infrastructure seamlessly across complex Kubernetes environments.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about deploying applications on Kubernetes:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-needs-to-take-a-lesson-from-portainer-on-ease-of-use/ \">Kubernetes Needs to Take a Lesson from Portainer on Ease-of-Use\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/three-common-kubernetes-challenges-and-how-to-solve-them/\">Three Common Kubernetes Challenges and How to Solve Them\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a>\u00a0</p>\n",
