    "Description": "\n        <p>If you\u2019ve ever heard that voice in your head telling you you\u2019re not smart enough or talented enough or good enough, Steven Pressfield says you\u2019re not alone. The bestselling author contends that no one\u2014regardless of who they are or what they do\u2014is immune to this sort of self-sabotage that he likes to call Resistance. Tune in as Steven explains why Resistance is so destructive and details how to not only defend yourself against it, but also overcome it for good.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2VGNyYA\">Steven Pressfield's website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Ma7hg1\">The War of Art</a> by Steven Pressfield</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/32aieUf\"><em>Composed: A Memoir</em></a> by Rosanne Cash</p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2II4qZo\">Masterclass with David Baldacci</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/33sxqfX\"><em>The Game of Numbers</em></a> by Nick Murray</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/33sgjur\"><em>Turning Pro</em></a> by Steven Pressfield</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3130GYY\"><em>Do the Work</em></a> by Steven Pressfield</p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2II14Wu\">Episode #331: Art Williams\u2014Accomplishing Impossible Goals</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2M8esVZ\">YouTube - Art Williams on How To Accomplish Impossible Goals</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2qK9c2H\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
