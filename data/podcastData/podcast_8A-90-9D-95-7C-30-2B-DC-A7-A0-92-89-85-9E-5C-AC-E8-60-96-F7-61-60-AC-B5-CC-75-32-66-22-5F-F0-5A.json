    "Description": "\n        <p>As one of the most successful creators on YouTube,&nbsp;Mark Rober doesn\u2019t see what he does as a business. Instead, it\u2019s a way to celebrate science in the most joyful way possible. While working as an engineer at NASA, he made his YouTube debut with a tutorial on how to make a gory Halloween costume with two iPads and a lot of duct tape. Over time, his videos became more elaborate, including a belly flop into a pool full of Jello, and a demo of a glitter-fart bomb to get revenge on porch pirates. Within a few years, Mark was teaching online science classes and selling subscription boxes for kids. Today, his YouTube channel has 5.5 billion views, 48 million subscribers\u2026and\u2013astonishingly, given that audience\u2013less than 150 videos. </p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
