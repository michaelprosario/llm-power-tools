    "Description": "<p>OpenTelemetry is defined by its creators as a collection of APIs used to instrument, generate, collect and export telemetry data for observability. This data is in the form of metrics, logs and traces and has emerged as a popular CNCF project. For this interview, we're delving deeper into OpenTelemetry and its metrics support which has just become generally available.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The specifications provided for the metrics protocol are designed to connect metrics to other signals and to provide a path to OpenCensus, which enables customers to migrate to OpenTelemetry and to work with existing metrics-instrumentation protocols and standards, including, of course, Prometheus.\u00a0</p><p>In this episode of<a href=\"/tag/the-new-stack-makers\"> The New Stack Makers podcast</a>, recorded on the show floor of<a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/\"> KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain</a>, <a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/morganmclean\">Morgan McLean</a>, director of product management, <a href=\"https://www.splunk.com/fr_fr\">Splunk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-young/\">Ted Young</a>, director of developer education, <a href=\"https://lightstep.com/\">LightStep</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldyla\">Daniel Dyla</a>, senior open source architect, <a href=\"https://www.dynatrace.com/\">Dynatrace</a> discussed how OpenTelemetry is evolving and the magic of observability in general for DevOps.</p>\n",
