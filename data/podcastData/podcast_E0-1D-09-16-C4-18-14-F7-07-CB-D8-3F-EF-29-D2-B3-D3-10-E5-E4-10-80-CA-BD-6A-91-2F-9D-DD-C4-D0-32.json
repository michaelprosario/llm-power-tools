    "Description": "<p>How would all this work in practice? Of course, any metric you set out can easily become a target that developers look to game. With Snapshot Reviews, the goal is to get a high level overview of a software team\u2019s total activity and then use AI to measure the complexity of the tasks and output.</p><p>If a pull request attached to a Jira ticket is evaluated as simple by the system, for example, and a programmer takes weeks to finish it, then their productivity would be scored poorly. If a coder pushes code changes only once or twice a week, but the system rates them as complex and useful, then a high score would be awarded.\u00a0</p><p>You can learn more about Snapshot Reviews <a href=\"https://www.snapshot.reviews/\">here</a>.</p><p>You can learn more about Flatiron Software <a href=\"https://www.flatiron.software/\">here</a>.</p><p>Connect with Kirim on LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-kirimgeray-kirimli-72bbb838/\">here</a>.</p><p>Congrats to Stack Overflow user Cherry who earned a great question badge for asking: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37116864/is-it-safe-to-use-algorithm-inplace-for-mysql\">Is it safe to use ALGORITHM=INPLACE for MySQL?</a></p>\n",
