    "Description": "<p>Ivan Zhang, co-founder of Cohere, discusses the company's enterprise-focused AI solutions. He explains Cohere's early emphasis on embedding technology and training models for secure environments. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Zhang highlights their implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation in healthcare, significantly reducing doctor preparation time. He explores the shift from monolithic AI models to heterogeneous systems and the importance of improving various AI system components. Zhang shares insights on using synthetic data to teach models reasoning, the democratization of software development through AI, and how his gaming skills transfer to running an AI company. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>He advises young developers to fully embrace AI technologies and offers perspectives on AI reliability, potential risks, and future model architectures.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>https://cohere.com/</p>\n<p>https://ivanzhang.ca/</p>\n<p>https://x.com/1vnzh</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>00:00:00 Intro</p>\n<p>00:03:20 AI &amp; Language Model Evolution</p>\n<p>00:06:09 Future AI Apps &amp; Development</p>\n<p>00:09:29 Impact on Software Dev Practices</p>\n<p>00:13:03 Philosophical &amp; Societal Implications</p>\n<p>00:16:30 Compute Efficiency &amp; RAG</p>\n<p>00:20:39 Adoption Challenges &amp; Solutions</p>\n<p>00:22:30 GPU Optimization &amp; Kubernetes Limits</p>\n<p>00:24:16 Cohere's Implementation Approach</p>\n<p>00:28:13 Gaming's Professional Influence</p>\n<p>00:34:45 Transformer Optimizations</p>\n<p>00:36:45 Future Models &amp; System-Level Focus</p>\n<p>00:39:20 Inference-Time Computation &amp; Reasoning</p>\n<p>00:42:05 Capturing Human Thought in AI</p>\n<p>00:43:15 Research, Hiring &amp; Developer Advice</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>REFS:</p>\n<p>00:02:31 Cohere, https://cohere.com/</p>\n<p>00:02:40 The Transformer architecture, https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762</p>\n<p>00:03:22 The Innovator's Dilemma, https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/1633691780</p>\n<p>00:09:15 The actor model, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model</p>\n<p>00:14:35 John Searle's Chinese Room Argument, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/</p>\n<p>00:18:00 Retrieval-Augmented Generation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401</p>\n<p>00:18:40 Retrieval-Augmented Generation, https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag</p>\n<p>00:35:39 Let\u2019s Verify Step by Step, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.20050</p>\n<p>00:39:20 Adaptive Inference-Time Compute, https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02725</p>\n<p>00:43:20 Ryan Greenblatt ARC entry, https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This show is part of our Cohere partnership series</p>\n",
