    "Description": "<p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, hosted by Joab Jackson, managing editor for The New Stack, we speak two of the fabled conference\u2019s key organizers about what to expect and what the organizers\u2019 goals are: Priyanka Sharma, general manager for CNCF and Stephen Augustus, engineering director and head of open source at Cisco.</p>\n<p>This is no business-as-usual KubeCon conference, of course. Last year\u2019s KubeCon EU was cancelled just a few weeks before the event was scheduled to take place. Then, many question marks remained during the early days of the pandemic about not only the future of conferences but how workers in the IT industry would continue to live and work. As it turns out, this year\u2019s event is virtual, of course, and at the very least, there is no shortage of talks and events.</p>\n<p>All told, for KubeCon, experts from organizations including Adobe, Apple, CERN, Nvidia and OVHcloud will deliver more than 100 sessions, keynotes, lightning talks, and breakout sessions. There will also be more than 60 sessions hosted by project maintainers \u2013 spanning beginner-level introductions, end-user case studies and technical deep dives.</p>\n",
