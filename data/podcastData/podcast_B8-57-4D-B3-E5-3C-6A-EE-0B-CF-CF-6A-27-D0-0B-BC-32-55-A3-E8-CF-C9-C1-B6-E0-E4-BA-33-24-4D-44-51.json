    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of <em>The Double Win Show</em>, Michael and Megan Hyatt Miller sit down with bestselling author and trauma-informed coach, Mastin Kipp, to discuss the profound impact of understanding and regulating the nervous system. Mastin shares insights from his new book, <em>Reclaim Your Nervous System</em>, and explains how unresolved trauma and dysregulation can hinder personal and professional growth.</p><p><br>The conversation explores the practical applications of polyvagal theory, co-regulation, and how leaders can foster psychological safety by mastering their own nervous systems. Mastin covers everything from the body's hierarchy of responses to stress (green, yellow, and red states), to the effects of trauma on leadership, parenting, and personal well-being. By learning how to identify and manage these states, listeners can unlock a new level of performance and healing.</p><p><br>Memorable Quotes</p><ol><li>\u201cWe have this idea that \u2018If I can change my thoughts, I can change my life,\u2019 which is accurate, but there\u2019s a lot going on below the brain that we also want to understand.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThe issue is when we have a neuroceptive mismatch, where I\u2019m in the presence of something dangerous, but I\u2019m not being activated to move. Or I\u2019m not in the presence of danger, but my neuroception is telling me that I am.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI think of re-regulation as like the bicep curl or the squat. You\u2019re going to get dysregulated automatically. So let\u2019s re-regulate\u2014the re-regulation is the rep.\u201d</li><li>\u201cIf the leader, or CEO, or C-Suite isn\u2019t creating that culture [of safety], then it will fall apart when there are challenges. Just like we need to have a flexible nervous system, we need to have a flexible cultural nervous system to be able to manage the flexible challenges of business also.\u201d</li><li>\u201cTrauma is any experience of threat, disconnection, isolation, or immobilization that results in the long-term or chronic dysregulation of either your endocrine system, your immune system, your emotional body, your brain, your body, your spirit\u2014your health on any level, basically.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThe problem with successful people and ambitious people is every time we level up, we increase complexity and stress, and those pathways get activated again.\u201d</li><li>\u201cStoicism is great for growth. It\u2019s just not great for healing.\u201d</li></ol><p><br>Key Takeaways</p><ol><li><strong>Understanding the Nervous System:</strong> The nervous system governs how we experience life. Recognizing when we are in a \"fight or flight\" state (yellow) or a \"shut down\" state (red) allows us to make conscious decisions to move back into a \"ventral vagal\" state (green), where we're most productive and connected.</li><li><strong>The Power of Co-Regulation:</strong> Leaders, parents, and partners all play a role in co-regulating others. Learning how to stay calm and collected can positively influence those around you, fostering a more supportive and effective environment.</li><li><strong>Trauma\u2019s Role in Leadership:</strong> Unresolved trauma can cause leaders to react disproportionately, affecting their teams and overall performance. Recognizing and healing these trauma responses is essential for effective leadership.</li><li><strong>Reframing Anxiety and Stress:</strong> Instead of seeing anxiety as an isolated mental challenge, Mastin explains how it's deeply tied to our physical nervous system and can be addressed by body-based approaches like somatic experiencing.</li><li><strong>Neuroception and Safety:</strong> Our bodies are constantly scanning for safety or danger. Learning to re-regulate when our neuroception is triggered can help us stay present and avoid unnecessary reactions to perceived threats.</li><li><strong>Reclaim Your Life:</strong> Trauma doesn't need to define your future. By understanding your nervous system, you can reclaim your happiness and make progress in all areas of life, from work to personal relationships.</li></ol><p><br>Resources</p><ul><li><strong>Mastin Kipp on Instagram:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mastinkipp/\">@mastinkipp</a></li><li><strong>Mastin Kipp\u2019s Book:</strong> <em>Reclaim Your Nervous System</em></li></ul><p><br>Watch on YouTube at:\u00a0 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hhMXVMNDCIY\">https://youtu.be/hhMXVMNDCIY</a></p><p><br>This episode was produced by Sarah Vorhees Wendel of VW Sound</p><p><br></p>\n      ",
