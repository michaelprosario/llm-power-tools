    "Description": "<p>Aja Hammerly, director of developer relations at Google, sees AI as the always-available coding partner developers have long wished for\u2014especially in those late-night bursts of inspiration. In a conversation with Alex Williams at Google Cloud Next, she described AI-assisted coding as akin to having a virtual pair programmer who can fill in gaps and offer real-time support.\u00a0</p><p>Hammerly urges developers to start their AI journey with tools that assist in code writing and explanation before moving into more complex AI agents. She distinguishes two types of DevEx AI: using AI to build apps and using it to eliminate developer toil. For Hammerly, this includes letting AI handle frontend work while she focuses on backend logic. The newly launched Firebase Studio exemplifies this dual approach, offering an AI-enhanced IDE with flexible tools like prototyping, code completion, and automation. Her advice? Developers should explore how AI fits into their unique workflow\u2014because development, at its core, is deeply personal and individual.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest AI insights with Google Cloud:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/google-ai-coding-tool-now-free-with-90x-copilots-output/\">Google AI Coding Tool Now Free, With 90x Copilot\u2019s Output</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/gemini-2-5-pro-googles-coding-genius-gets-an-upgrade/\">Gemini 2.5 Pro: Google\u2019s Coding Genius Gets an Upgrade</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/qa-how-google-itself-uses-its-gemini-large-language-model/\">Q&A: How Google Itself Uses Its Gemini Large Language Model</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
