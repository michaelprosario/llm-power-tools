    "Description": "When she goes to events, she no longer writes her own name on her name tag. Instead, she writes \u201cBrianna\u2019s Mother\u201d. Ronique, the proud single-mother of a coder talks to us about how she supports and advocates for her daughter, and what it\u2019s been like to see her only child take advantage of the many tech opportunities she\u2019s come by. Brianna tells us how she switched from being pre-med to computer science, and got over the intimidation of sitting next to kids who\u2019d discovered coding long before she knew what programming was all about. She tells us her inspiring stories of working at the White House under US CTO Megan Smith, and coding alongside Googlers, all as a college undergrad. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
