Yaakov is a Principal Web Developer, Community Advocate on the Public Platform team at Stack Overflow, and Former Team Lead for Internal Development at Stack. Stephanie is the Program Manager for Community Strategy at Stack.\u00a0</p><p>Want to learn more about how the Community-athon worked? Read up on it <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/20/the-loop-august-2020-community-a-thon/\">here</a>. And yes, of course there was a leaderboard and internet points.\u00a0</p><p>Yaakov was undercover as a brand new user, but some of his answers gave him away. Can you spot the tell?\u00a0</p><p>Our very own CEO spent a lot of time asking extremely important and nerdy question on our <a href=\"https://scifi.stackexchange.com/\">SciFi</a> Stack Exchange.\u00a0</p><p>We bumped our engagement from employees by more than 100%. Many questions were asked, much knowledge was spread.</p>\n",
