    "Description": "<p>When I called Principal Ryan Kaczmark, he bubbled over with excitement from the Lemonade Wars experience. This elementary school-wide reading project is a sizzling combination of reading, parent relations, community service, school spirit, communications, and social media savvy. We were going to talk about technology or school design or something else. But I'm happy that he talked about the Lemonade Wars and raising money for Mike's Lemonade stand to help childhood cancer and everything that had just happened. I had to let him tell his story. This literally came out as I called him so today's Wonderful Wednesday with Ryan Kaczmark sounds more like a phone call between an excited educator (Ryan) and a curious one (me) than a \"show.\" But that's OK.
