    "Description": "<p>What happened to Windows 10X? Richard chats with Paul Thurrott about the ongoing saga at Microsoft to create a lighter version of Windows that can compete with iOS and ChromeOS. Paul talks about various incarnations along the way, including Windows ARM and Windows 10S - Windows 10X is just the latest victim of an extremely challenging problem. Windows has always been about maintaining backward compatibility - but does that still make sense today? What are we willing to do to increase security and reduce complexity?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop/\">Windows Virtual Desktop</a></li><li><a href=\"https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2021/03/02/announcing-windows-server-2022-now-in-preview/\">Windows Server 2022</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion\">Project Reunion</a></li></ul>\n",
