The conversation starts with a broad discussion of reorganizations and reasons that companies choose to undertake them. They then consider organizational behavior and topics such as Conway's law and the theory of constraints. Han offers some advice on key steps to take when planning for a reorg, including how software teams could organize themselves based on technology, frameworks, or user journeys. The episode ends with some discussion of metrics and lessons learned. Brought to you by IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Software magazine.</p>",
