    "Description": "It was late at night when Sudie ran to her bus stop after a long day at work, just in time to see the bus pull away. And then it started raining. She took this moment to reflect on her life, and ask herself questions about her goals and her dreams, questions that led to her moving to Utah, getting a computer science degree, and working as a developer for the Air Force. She tells us how she made the career change and what she learned along the way. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie! (sponsor)  Try Ruby Java Codeland Conf Codeland 2019 ",
