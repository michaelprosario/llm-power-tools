    "Description": "<p>Software is eating the world, but what's on the menu for dessert?</p><p>This week we chat about the best way for engineers to give feedback to executives. Paul explains the Purple room method they use at Postlight. Sara references <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296\"><i>Zero to One</i></a> and why engineers and marketers have so much trouble communicating.</p><p>As a member of a marketing department , it's true our job is to see the glass as half full. But sometimes the point of the exercise is to be aspirational. Police <a href=\"https://opus.uleth.ca/bitstream/handle/10133/1150/Fuller_Merle_E.pdf\">learn how to be suspicious</a>, marketers learn how to sell, and engineers look for what's broken so they can fix it.</p><p>We chat about the ten thousand or so parking meters that <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/transportation/Software-Glitch-Stops-Credit-Card-Use-in-NYC-Parking-Meters.html\">went on the fritz</a> in New York City. The company says it was the result of a fraud prevention protocol. Was this a Y2K style glitch or a logic bomb?</p><p>Sara finds the developer angle on the recent rift in the British Royal Family. New technologies always reshape the Monarchy's relationship to the public. From the first radio address to the televised coronation, to <a href=\"https://sussexroyal.com/funding/\">a Wordpress website</a> and an Instagram post, each generation tries to use the modern medium to their advantage.</p><p>We discuss a fairly devious bit of brilliant parenting. If your young child wants to be a YouTube star, and you can build them their own private version of the platform, with randomly generated likes and none of the cyber-bullying, are you protecting them? Or, perhaps, crafting a Truman Show for the internet age that will have consequences down the road.</p><p>Last but not least, we check out the Blazor tag, one of the fastest growing areas of interest on Stack Overflow. It's a framework that extends the established Razor syntax. The goal is to enable developers to write client-side code in .NET, backed by <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webassembly\">WebAssembly</a>.</p>\n",
