    "Description": "<p>Have you upgraded to TLS 1.3? While at NDC in London, Richard chatted with Scott Helme about his work moving companies onto the latest version of TLS. But do you need to? Scott talks about how SSL 2 and 3 were used until they were broken by the black hats, leading to a panic to update quickly. While there is no evidence that TLS 1 and 1.1 are breached, they are already deprecated - and are slower than the later versions. Want a performance boost? Move to TLS 1.3!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/4219\">KeybaseAPI Root Certificate Expiry</a></li><li><a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let's Encrypt</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2021-05-04-brownout-notice-api-authentication-via-query-parameters-and-the-oauth-applications-api-for-12-hours/\">Brownout Notice at GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://scotthelme.co.uk/when-logging-causes-security-incidents-what-we-learned-from-github-and-twitter/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk\">When Logging Causes Security Incidents</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sysinternals/announce/sha1deprecation?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Deprecation SHA-1</a></li><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/why-google-now-uses-post-quantum-cryptography-for-internal-comms\">Google Post Quantum Encryption</a></li></ul><p>Recorded February 1, 2024</p>\n",
