    "Description": "\n        <p>When Ben Leventhal first started blogging about New York City\u2019s restaurant scene in the early 2000s, he was doing it as a hobby. But as the website Eater gained weight and spread to other cities, it became a snarkily influential voice in the dining world. Recognizing that many restaurants struggle to survive, Ben then co-founded Resy, a booking app that squeezed more value into seats by charging diners higher rates for a hot table. When this business model flopped, Resy made a rapid pivot that eventually paid off, with an acquisition by American Express for $200 million in 2019.</p><p>This episode was researched and produced by Sam Paulson with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
