It is from what I call my \"legacy project,\" Cool Cat Teacher Talk, soon to be released as its separate podcast. In this, I'll tell you about the Cool Cat Teacher Talk Show project, why I'm doing it, and how it is being created and shared. Then, I'll share my 58-minute Cool Cat Teacher talk episode on Gratitude and Thankfulness. I hope you enjoy the show.\u00a0</p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/talkgratitude\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/talkgratitude</a></p>",
