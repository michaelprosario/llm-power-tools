    "Description": "<p> Today I'm joined by Lynn Zheng. She's a software engineer at freeCodeCamp and at Salesforce.</p> <p>Lynn grew up in Shenzhen, China \u2013 the computer hardware capital of the world. Both of her parents were engineers. And from an early age, they encouraged Lynn to learn math and computer science. She got into the prestigious Computer Science program at University of Chicago, where she earned both Bachelors and Masters degree \u2013 all by the age of 21.</p> <p>I met up with Lynn at the Redwood City Public Library in the heart of Silicon Valley. But they didn't have any study rooms available. so we climbed to a nearby rooftop and recorded there.</p> <p>We talk about Lynn's many game development projects, which culminated in Learn to Code RPG, a Visual Novel game where you learn to code and get a developer job. And we talk about her experience working as an engineer at one of the largest tech companies in the world, even as she's stuck in work visa limbo.</p> <p> Next week will be our 100th episode, and I've got something extra special in store for you.</p> <p>Tell your friends about the freeCodeCamp podcast. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themsleves in tech.</p> <p>Learn to Code RPG: <a href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-rpg/\">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-rpg/</a></p> <p>Lynn's Stable Diffusion course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/stable-diffusion-crash-course/</p> <p>Lynn on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lynnzheng08</p> <p>Lynn on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruolin-zheng/</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
