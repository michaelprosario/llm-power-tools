    "Description": "<p>Kubevirt, a relatively new capability within Kubernetes, signifies a shift in the virtualization landscape, allowing operations teams to run KVM virtual machines nested in containers behind the Kubernetes API. This integration means that the Kubernetes API now encompasses the concept of virtual machines, enabling VM-based workloads to operate seamlessly within a cluster behind the API. This development addresses the challenge of transitioning traditional virtualized environments into cloud-native settings, where certain applications may resist containerization or require substantial investments for adaptation.</p><p>The emerging era of virtualization simplifies the execution of virtual machines without concerning the underlying infrastructure, presenting various opportunities and use cases. Noteworthy advantages include simplified migration of legacy applications without the need for containerization, thereby reducing associated costs.</p><p>Kubevirt 1.1, discussed at KubeCon in Chicago by Red Hat's Vladik Romanovsky and Nvidia's Ryan Hallisey, introduces features like memory hotplug and vCPU hotplug, emphasizing the stability of Kubevirt. The platform's stability now allows for the implementation of features that were previously constrained.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Kubevirt and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-vms-on-kubernetes-building-on-kubevirt/\">The Future of VMs on Kubernetes: Building on KubeVirt</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/a-platform-for-kubernetes/\">A Platform for Kubernetes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/scaling-open-source-community-by-getting-closer-to-users/\">Scaling Open Source Community by Getting Closer to Users</a></p>\n",
