You hop on. 'Hey, how are you? Do you need a five minute break?' We would train interviewers on some of those tactics, right? At the beginning of the call, set the agenda. \u2018We're going to spend this amount of time on these topics. We're going to spend this amount of time to give you space to ask questions of me.\u2019 Now the candidate knows what to expect. They're put at ease. It's simple stuff but it really colors the way that people feel about the interview itself. What kind of feeling do they have about the company coming out of it?\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Stephen Poletto \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Join us at</strong> <a href=\"https://sfelc.com/annual2024\"><strong>ELC Annual 2024!</strong></a></h2><p>ELC Annual is our 2 day conference bringing together engineering leaders from around the world for a unique experience help you expand your network and empower your leadership & career growth.</p><p>Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to expand your network, gain actionable insights, ignite new ideas, recharge, and accelerate your leadership journey!</p><h3>Secure your ticket at <a href=\"http://sfelc.com/annual2024\">sfelc.com/annual2024</a></h3><p><i>And use the exclusive discount code \"<strong>podcast10</strong>\" (all lowercase) for a 10% discount</i></p><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Stephen\u2019s primary goal when he first joined Lattice (3:15)</li><li>Steps for building out a systematic & repeatable hiring process (5:51)</li><li>Defining & articulating employee value propositions during the hiring process (8:00)</li><li>Strategies for presenting company culture via hiring / onboarding (10:21)</li><li>Hiring experience differentiators & how to make them the norm (13:27)</li><li>Training the engineering team on how to effectively hire (16:53)</li><li>Stephen\u2019s process for creating a hiring rubric & loop documentation (20:06)</li><li>How hiring systems can be tweaked / evaluating current hiring needs (22:20)</li><li>Identifying what operational excellence means for your org (24:22)</li><li>Rituals / dilemmas to focus on that influence psychology & behavior (26:13)</li><li>Examples of ending & replacing processes / operations (29:58)</li><li>Signals that a ritual is no longer serving your needs (32:12)</li><li>Frameworks for applying incentives / rewards within an eng org (34:57)</li><li>Navigating the balance between output vs. input (38:57)</li><li>First steps toward better organizational impact & avoiding bad incentives (41:07)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (43:37)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/product-led-ai/id1743823599\">Product-Led AI</a> - Greylock partner and former product builder Seth Rosenberg talks with founders about their inspiration and process to build, test, and continually reimagine how AI and humans work together.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation/preview\">The Holloway Guide to Equity Compensation</a> - Stock options, RSUs, job offers, and taxes\u2014a detailed reference, including hundreds of resources, explained from the ground up, for both employees and managers.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.gem.com/author/steve-bartel\">Steve Bartel\u2019s blog</a> - Steve Bartel is the co-founder and CEO of Gem.
