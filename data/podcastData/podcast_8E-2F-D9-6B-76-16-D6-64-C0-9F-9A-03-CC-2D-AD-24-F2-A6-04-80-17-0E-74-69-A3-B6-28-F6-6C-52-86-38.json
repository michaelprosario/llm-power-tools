If your early sales team is not successful, it's never the sales team. It's always the product. Where bigger companies have built new products, they've probably taken it to market too soon and the salespeople will take it to a mature account. It won't be as mature as the other products. The customer will complain and the salespeople will hate it. It'll get a bad name and then it'll get killed. That's the typical mode of operation that I've seen in a large company, which is why you got to keep it a secret until you've got the MVP, then work with a small set of customers and set the right expectation. When you get it right, you've immediately got a distribution channel that you can scale. If you get it wrong, you'll never scale it and you'll just create a whole bunch of problems in your customer base.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Jeremy Burton \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>We now have 10 local communities of engineering leaders hosting in-person meetups all over the world!</h2><p>Local communities are led by eng leaders just like you, who wanted to create a place to connect, share insights & tackle critical challenges in the job.</p><p><strong>New York City, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, London, Amsterdam,</strong> and <strong>Toronto</strong> in-person events are happening now!</p><h3>We\u2019re launching local events all the time - get involved at elc.community!</h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Operating at a scale of 13,000 people vs. early stage with 10 (3:13)</li><li>How Jeremy adapted to operating at vastly different scales (6:30)</li><li>Transitioning from a back seat role to the front seat (8:32)</li><li>Approaches to helping folks better operate in ambiguity & face the unknown (11:20)</li><li>Cycles that gave Jeremy more confidence to operate in instability (14:26)</li><li>The romanticization of start-ups & challenges with scaling (18:22)</li><li>Why eng teams should work directly with customers at start-ups (21:14)</li><li>Leveraging leadership at large orgs to bring eng teams closer to customers (24:36)</li><li>Strategies for innovation at large-scale orgs (27:38)</li><li>Dynamics at big companies that incentivize killing new projects (30:38)</li><li>Characters of eng leaders that lead to successful scaling / innovation (32:56)</li><li>Recommendations for gaining conviction & communicating that effectively (34:33)</li><li>Conversation frameworks for creating alignment (37:43)</li><li>How to create influence & community engagement for developers (38:55)</li><li>Gaining trust within your community & exuding authenticity (42:10)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (44:42)</li></ul><h3><strong>This episode wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the help of our incredible production team:</strong></h3><p>Patrick Gallagher - Producer & Co-Host</p><p>Jerry Li - Co-Host</p><p>Noah Olberding - Associate Producer, Audio & Video Editor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/</a></p><p>Dan Overheim - Audio Engineer, Dan\u2019s also an avid 3D printer - <a href=\"https://www.bnd3d.com/\">https://www.bnd3d.com/</a></p><p>Ellie Coggins Angus - Copywriter, Check out her other work at <a href=\"https://elliecoggins.com/about/\">https://elliecoggins.com/about/</a></p>\n",
