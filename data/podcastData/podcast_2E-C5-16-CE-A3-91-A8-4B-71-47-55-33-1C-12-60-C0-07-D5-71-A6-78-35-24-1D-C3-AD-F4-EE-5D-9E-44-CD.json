    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews John Washam, a software engineer at Amazon. John's also creator of one of the most popular open source projects of all time, Coding Interview University.</p> <p>This is John's first-ever podcast interview, and the first time he's told his story. Interviewing him was an absolute honor.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How John delivered pizzas to save enough money to buy his first computer in the 90s. \"I was tired of being a broke kid.\"</p> <p>- John's first career in the US military, where he worked as a translator in South Korea</p> <p>- How John crammed Computer Science for 8 months and taught himself enough theory and coding skills to get a job in big tech, then published Coding Interview University on GitHub</p> <p>- What it's like to work as a senior developer at a big tech company, and what you can expect the journey to be like</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1986 rock song.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 9,779 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
