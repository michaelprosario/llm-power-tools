Because how do I know that the cash I'm generating is a good or bad? I use a very simple metric. If you take the enterprise value and you multiply it by the cost of borrowing money, your free cash flow must be higher than that product. When I'm doing better than that metric, then I know that I have a future.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Sandeep Chennakeshu \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Looking for ways to support the show?</strong></h2><p>Send a link to the show to your marketing team! <a href=\"https://sfelc.com/podcasts\">https://sfelc.com/podcasts</a></p><p>If your company is looking to gain exposure to thousands of engineering leaders and key decision-makers, we have sponsorship opportunities available.</p><h3><strong>To explore sponsor opportunities, email us at</strong> <a href=\"mailto:hello@sfelc.com\"><strong>hello@sfelc.com</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Sandeep\u2019s most significant career milestones (2:23)</li><li>Why there is no difference between an eng leader & GM (6:39)</li><li>Sandeep\u2019s passion for & background of transforming business (9:18)</li><li>Key structural elements of successful companies (12:17)</li><li>How a successful business resembles a castle (13:59)</li><li>Strategies to improve financial fitness & generate cash flow (15:17)</li><li>Metrics to determine how well you\u2019re optimizing your cash flow (17:54)</li><li>Examples of how strong decision-making led to cost savings (19:45)</li><li>Frameworks for overcoming operational inefficiencies (22:12)</li><li>Sandeep\u2019s tips for categorizing / prioritizing where the cashflow\u2019s impact hits (24:21)</li><li>Why it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the \u201cgorilla in the room\u201d (26:33)</li><li>Resilient business models utilize stickiness & have high operating leverage (28:23)</li><li>Questions eng leaders can ask to adopt a more effective GM mindset (33:30)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (36:02)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.williamury.com/books/getting-to-yes/\">Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In</a>: This worldwide bestseller by William Ury provides a concise, step-by-step, proven strategy for coming to mutually acceptable agreements in every sort of conflict.</li></ul><h3><strong>This episode wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the help of our incredible production team:</strong></h3><p>Patrick Gallagher - Producer & Co-Host</p><p>Jerry Li - Co-Host</p><p>Noah Olberding - Associate Producer, Audio & Video Editor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/</a></p><p>Dan Overheim - Audio Engineer, Dan\u2019s also an avid 3D printer - <a href=\"https://www.bnd3d.com/\">https://www.bnd3d.com/</a></p><p>Ellie Coggins Angus - Copywriter, Check out her other work at <a href=\"https://elliecoggins.com/about/\">https://elliecoggins.com/about/</a></p>\n",
