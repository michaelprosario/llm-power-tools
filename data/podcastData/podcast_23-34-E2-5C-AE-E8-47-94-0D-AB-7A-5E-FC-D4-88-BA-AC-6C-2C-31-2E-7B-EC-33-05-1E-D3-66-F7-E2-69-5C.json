    "Description": "<p>Generative AI is a data-driven story with significant infrastructure and operational implications, particularly around the rising demand for GPUs, which are better suited for AI workloads than CPUs. In an episode of<i>The New Stack Makers</i>recorded at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America, Sudha Raghavan, SVP for Developer Platform at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, discussed how AI\u2019s rapid adoption has reshaped infrastructure needs.</p><p>The release of ChatGPT triggered a surge in GPU demand, with organizations requiring GPUs for tasks ranging from testing workloads to training large language models across massive GPU clusters. These workloads run continuously at peak power, posing challenges such as high hardware failure rates and energy consumption.</p><p>Oracle is addressing these issues by building GPU superclusters and enhancing Kubernetes functionality. Tools like Oracle\u2019s Node Manager simplify interactions between Kubernetes and GPUs, providing tailored observability while maintaining Kubernetes\u2019 user-friendly experience. Raghavan emphasized the importance of stateful job management and infrastructure innovations to meet the demands of modern AI workloads.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about how Oracle is addressing the GPU\u00a0demand for AI workloads with its GPU superclusters and enhancing Kubernetes functionality:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/oracle-code-assist-java-optimized-now-in-beta/ \">Oracle Code Assist, Java-Optimized, Now in Beta</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/oracles-code-assist-fashionably-late-to-the-genai-party/ \">Oracle\u2019s Code Assist: Fashionably Late to the GenAI Party</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/oracle-unveils-java-23-simplicity-meets-enterprise-power/ \">Oracle Unveils Java 23: Simplicity Meets Enterprise Power</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a>\u00a0</p>\n",
