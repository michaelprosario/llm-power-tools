    "Description": "<p>Laura Tacho, CTO @ DX, joins us to discuss why changing what you measure doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to improved productivity (and what to do about it)! How to define and measure productivity in your eng org is one of the hottest topics for eng leaders\u2026 We cover best practices for identifying what productivity looks like in your org, what motivates your team to reach those goals, how to harness behavioral psychology, and antipatterns to avoid when you focus on productivity. Plus Laura shares some of her favorite practices to identify your skill gaps, and how define what success looks like for yourself and your teams on your productivity journey.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauratacho/\"><strong>LAURA TACHO</strong></a></h2><p>Laura Tacho is CTO at DX, a developer experience company. She previously led teams at companies like CloudBees, Aula Education, and Nova Credit. She\u2019s an expert in building world-class engineering organizations that consistently deliver outstanding results. Laura has coached CTOs and other engineering leaders from startups to the Fortune 500, and also facilitates a popular course on metrics and engineering team performance.</p><blockquote><p>\"That is just a ripe environment for the rapid degradation of trust within an organization and has immeasurable consequences when it comes to degrading the culture of a team. I think the temptation is there, understandably, and I think from good intentions of, \u2018I want to try to measure unobtrusively. I want to get this data about my team without them knowing about it or minimally knowing about it so that I'm not bothering them.\u2019 That is a trap because we don't need to treat people the same way we treat distributed systems with dashboards and dashboards of telemetry data. People can talk. Just ask them.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Laura Tacho \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a> is trusted by hundreds of tech-led companies across the globe, including Etsy, <a href=\"http://monday.com/\">monday.com</a>, Skyscanner and more to seamlessly orchestrate incident response from start to finish.
