    "Description": "<p>Platform engineering is gaining prominence due to the need for faster application deployment, which directly impacts business velocity. Valentina Alaria, Senior Director of Product at VMware, emphasizes that not all organizations pursuing platform engineering have the same goals, context, or pain points. They tailor solutions to each organization's specific needs. Some focus on rapid onboarding for junior developers, while others aim to reduce complexity, friction, and support larger development teams with fewer operational staff.</p><p>Platform engineering aims to streamline collaboration between developers and operations engineers. Developers want portable code and the ability to focus on coding without worrying about production requirements. Operations engineers and platform teams seek a seamless environment for deploying applications in different contexts.</p><p>Successful platform engineering initiatives involve strong collaboration models, fostering a cooperative approach rather than a siloed one. The goal is to create applications and value for the organization by facilitating effective interaction between developers and operations engineers.</p><p>This podcast episode, hosted by Alex Williams of TNS, also delves into VMware Tanzu's latest tools for supporting platform engineering.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about platform engineering and VMware Tanzu:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/\">Platform Engineering Overview, News and Trends</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/6-patterns-for-platform-engineering-success/\">6 Patterns for Platform Engineering Success</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-open-source-platform-engineering/\">A Guide to Open Source Platform Engineering</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/streamline-platform-engineering-with-kubernetes/\">Streamline Platform Engineering with Kubernetes</a></p>\n",
