    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Stephen Foskett about building data centers for virtual servers. The conversation ranges over how virtualization has evolved from consolidating servers in data centers into the newer concepts of private cloud, where being able to move and/or duplicate a virtual machine quickly becomes paramount. Stephen focuses on the challenges around data in these scenarios and how traditional disaster recovery techniques for data migration are inadequate. In 2012 Stephen will be doing a series of seminars on building virtual infrastructure - check them out for more information!</p>\n",
