Previously, Bill was Senior Vice President of Engineering at Google with oversight of Chrome, YouTube, maps, <a href=\"http://google.com/\">google.com</a>, underlying infrastructure systems, and security.</p><blockquote><p>\"If a leader comes in and talks about, 'I did this and I did that' rather than talking about the teams that they worked with in the past... The reality is the work got done by others.</p><p>And so, I think it's critical for more senior people to recognize the importance of an overall team. And part of their job is to help mentor and develop people on the team.</p><p>- Bill Coughran\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/melodymeckfessel/\"><strong>MELODY MECKFESSEL</strong></a></h2><p>Melody <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmeckf\">(@mmeckf)</a> is the CEO / Co-founder of <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/\">Observable</a>, where she is building the future of data collaboration.
