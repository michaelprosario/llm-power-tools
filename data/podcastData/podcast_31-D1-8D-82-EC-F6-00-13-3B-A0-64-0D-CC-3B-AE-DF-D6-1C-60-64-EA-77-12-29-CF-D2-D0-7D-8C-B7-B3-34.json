They actually want the process for the part that is mundane and boring and disruptive. So as they discuss about what's making their life harder than it needs to be, we are coming back to a lack of process, a lack of uniformity, a lack of clear communication channels between themselves or between other departments.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Madalina Tanasie \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Check out</strong> <a href=\"http://www.qawolf.com/elc\"><strong>QA Wolf</strong></a><strong>!</strong></h2><p>Looking for a way to increase end-to-end test coverage, speed up your release cycles and reduce bugs from shipping to production?
