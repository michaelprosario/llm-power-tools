    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode, Margot Gerritsen and Jon Krohn discuss the fundamentals of computational mathematics and its application in studying fluid dynamics. Margot also talks about how her synesthesia led to a lifelong interest in math, using computational mathematics to predict airflow, and why it is so important that underrepresented groups in data science become more visible through organizations like Women in Data Science.<br><br>This episode is brought to you by the <a href=\"https://www.zerve.ai/\">Zerve</a> data science dev environment, by <a href=\"https://gurobi.com/sds\">Gurobi</a>, the Decision Intelligence Leader, and by <a href=\"https://odsc.com/\">ODSC</a>, the Open Data Science Conference.
