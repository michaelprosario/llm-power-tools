    "Description": "\n        <p>We can all agree the last year put us to the test! Has fighting through all of the craziness put your relationships on the back burner? You\u2019re not alone, and we can help. In this episode of <em>The EntreLeadership Podcast</em>, we sit down with Dr. Darren Whitehead, the senior pastor of Church of the City in Franklin, Tennessee. He talks about how we, as leaders, can create deep, meaningful relationships with the teams we serve. Then in our second segment, we chat with with Ramsey Solutions\u2019 Chief People Officer Jack Galloway. He gives you the questions you need to ask to discover if you care more about your ambition or your team\u2019s well-being.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6326584/a4a9eea55e60\">Take <em>The EntreLeadership Podcast</em> Audience Survey</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/shows/the-entreleadership-podcast\"><em>The EntreLeadership Podcast</em></a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2SvHMeZ\">Church of the City website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/32JOkJT\"><em>Upstream</em></a> by Dan Heath</p><p><em>The EntreLeadership Podcast</em>: <a href=\"https://apple.co/3aJzYNF\">The Importance of Looking Upstream with Dan Heath</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3ezZYN5\">Ramsey Solutions\u2019 website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/34qtD54\">Learn more about EntreLeadership Elite Coaching</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2x9XqP1\">43 Easy Ways to Recognize Your Team</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3aK6crS\">Schedule a call with Tim, our producer</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more about the offers from our <a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/business/entreleadership/partners\"> EntreLeadership Partners</a>:</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3epUiVK\">BELAY</a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https://lp.gravysolutions.io/entreleadership\">Gravy</a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.hitedigital.com/entreleadership/\">Hite Digital</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Want expert help with your business question?
