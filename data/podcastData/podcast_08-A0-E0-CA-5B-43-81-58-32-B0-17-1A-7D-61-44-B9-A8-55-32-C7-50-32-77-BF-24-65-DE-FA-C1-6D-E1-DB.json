    "Description": "\n        <p>This week marks the 18th anniversary of September 11, 2001, a day that forever changed our nation. And for a select few like Jason McCarthy, that tragedy\u00a0ignited a call to service that completely altered the trajectory of their life. In response to 9/11, Jason enlisted in the United States Army and went on to earn a spot in the elite Green Beret unit. And it was his military service that ultimately inspired the launch of his gear company, GORUCK. Tune in to hear Jason\u2019s story, a true testament to the power of resilience and daring to dream big dreams. But most of all, it\u2019s about what it means to serve a cause so much bigger than yourself.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2k3WrwV\">GORUCK website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2kywUfn\">GORUCK rucksacks</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2kmzEN6\">GORUCK events</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2m4T5KR\">Episode #332: Why Ramsey Solutions Is Built to Last</a></p> <p>Free download: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2LBtuon\">Chapter 1 of <em>EntreLeadership</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2kmxY6h\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
