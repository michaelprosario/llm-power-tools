She holds a bachelor of science from UCLA, and an MBA and Masters of Engineering Sciences from Harvard.</p><blockquote><p>\"Let's say in a four-month period, you check in with investors or founders that you're working with two or three times. Now what they have is not just one call to base their opinion on, but an entire story arc that they can use to say, 'All right, in August they were doing this and by October they already did this, and then by December they were here. I'm now seeing sort of a preview of what I'm backing.' I think that that really helps founders sort of help investors make decisions, right? You are de-risking for them, you are sharing more of the milestones as you're doing them.\u201d<br /><br />- Lizzie Matusov \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT </strong><a href=\"https://www.getquotient.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>QUOTIENT</strong></a></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.getquotient.com/\">Quotient</a> is a toolkit to supercharge engineering teams.
