    "Description": "<p>How does green fit into IT? Richard talks with Mike Halsey about his book The Green IT Guide. Mike starts out talking about not waiting for government regulation - there are things we can do today to reduce our organization's environmental impact. The trend is to keep PCs longer, but what happens when you need new ones? There are more organizations than ever for repurposing old PCs and other devices and recycling. The conversation also digs into right-to-repair, with replaceable batteries and upgradable parts. We can do a lot just by including environmental impact in our buying decisions!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-green-it-guide-ten-steps-toward-sustainable-and-carbon-neutral-it-infrastructure/34568689/#edition=61343457&idiq=58470480\">The Green IT Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://frame.work/\">Framework Laptop</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 12, 2023</p>\n",
