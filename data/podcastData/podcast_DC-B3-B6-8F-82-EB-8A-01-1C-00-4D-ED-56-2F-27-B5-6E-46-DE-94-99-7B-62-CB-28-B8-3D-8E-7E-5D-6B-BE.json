    "Description": "<p>In a rare show of collaboration, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have joined forces on Kro \u2014 the Kubernetes Resource Orchestrator \u2014 an open source, cloud-agnostic tool designed to simplify custom resource orchestration in Kubernetes. Announced during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, Kro was born from strong customer demand for a Kubernetes-native solution that works across cloud providers without vendor lock-in. Nic Slattery, Product Manager at Google and Jesse Butler, Principal Product Manager, AWS shared with The New Stack that unlike many enterprise products, Kro didn\u2019t stem from top-down strategy but from consistent customer \"pull\" experienced by all three companies. It aims to reduce complexity by allowing platform teams to offer simplified interfaces to developers, enabling resource requests without needing deep service-specific knowledge. Kro also represents a unique cross-company collaboration, driven by a shared mission and open source values. Though still in its alpha stage, the project has already attracted 57 contributors in just seven months. The team is now focused on refining core features and preparing for a production-ready release \u2014 all while maintaining a narrowly scoped, community-first approach.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about KRO:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/one-mighty-kro-one-giant-leap-for-kubernetes-resource-orchestration/\">One Mighty kro; One Giant Leap for Kubernetes Resource Orchestration</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-gets-a-new-resource-orchestrator-in-the-form-of-kro/\">Kubernetes Gets a New Resource Orchestrator in the Form of Kro</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/orchestrate-cloud-native-workloads-with-kro-and-kubernetes/\">Orchestrate Cloud Native Workloads With Kro and Kubernetes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
