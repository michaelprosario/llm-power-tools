    "Description": "We're LIVE at the historic Oriental Theater in Denver, CO with Nora Jones. Nora is the founder of Jeli.io, recently acquired by PagerDuty and she's been shaping the way we think about reliability, incident response, and human-centered engineering for years.\n\nWe get into the real story behind the deal. Not just the headline, but what it\u2019s like selling your company, what it takes to actually integrate a product into a larger platform, how customers responded, what changed for her team, and why her new role at PagerDuty is basically everything she was building Jeli for.",
