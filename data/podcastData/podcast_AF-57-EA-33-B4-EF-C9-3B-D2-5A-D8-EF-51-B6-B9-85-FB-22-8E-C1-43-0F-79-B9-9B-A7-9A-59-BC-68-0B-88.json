What's the impact? What's the revenue goals? What's the target market? How much time are we talking about? The ideas are plenty. There are a lot of great ideas. You have to figure out which great idea is gonna turn into the highest revenue and that's a very hard exercise. I've seen many leaders know that they have to do that, but not do that very diligently and in a very disciplined way.\u201d<br /><br />- Shailesh Kumar \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Check out</strong> <a href=\"http://www.qawolf.com/elc\"><strong>QA Wolf</strong></a><strong>!</strong></h2><p>Looking for a way to increase end-to-end test coverage, speed up your release cycles and reduce bugs from shipping to production?
