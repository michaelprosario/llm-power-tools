    "Description": "<p>This week Jonathan Bennett and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/dsearls\">Doc Searls</a> sit down with\u00a0<a href=\"https://x.com/mafintosh\">Mathias Buus Madsen</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/paoloardoino\">Paolo Ardoino</a> of Holepunch, to talk about the Pear Runtime and the Keet serverless peer-to-peer platform.\u00a0 What happens when you take the technology built for Bittorrent, and apply it to a messaging app? What else does that allow you to do? And what's the secret to keeping the service running even after the servers go down?</p> <p>You can join the conversation in\u00a0<a href= \"https://discord.gg/GNeFvChvnz?event=1217585022589206670\">the Hackaday Discord</a>, where the show records live each week, as well as getting the full story and show links from Hackaday.
