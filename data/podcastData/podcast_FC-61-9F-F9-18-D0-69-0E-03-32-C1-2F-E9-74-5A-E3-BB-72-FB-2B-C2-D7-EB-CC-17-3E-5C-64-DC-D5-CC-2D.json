    "Description": "<p>The worst show ever? Perhaps, but it's Meta! It's Joel Spolsky this week, the other half of the StackOverflow Podcast, chatting with Scott this week about podcasting. How does Joel record shows? How does Scott? Is this the end of the StackOverflow show? How does Leo Laporte manage? Should we visit his house? All this, plus sour grapes.</p>\n",
