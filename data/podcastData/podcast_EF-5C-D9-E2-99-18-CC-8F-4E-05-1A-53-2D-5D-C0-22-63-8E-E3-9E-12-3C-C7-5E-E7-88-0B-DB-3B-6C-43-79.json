    "Description": "<p>Mark Rendle has a twenty year career developing software for the desktop. He's long believed that the web just isn't meant for applications of any import. Until now. What changed in web development that caused Mark to take another look at the web and completely change his tune? NOTE: Mark is offering a discount code for HM listeners. It's &quot;HM20&quot; and is good for 20% off the first year of an annual subscription. For UK listeners that'll be \u00a340 instead of \u00a350, US $64 instead of $80. The code can be used at the payments page after the 30 day free trial expires.</p>\n",
