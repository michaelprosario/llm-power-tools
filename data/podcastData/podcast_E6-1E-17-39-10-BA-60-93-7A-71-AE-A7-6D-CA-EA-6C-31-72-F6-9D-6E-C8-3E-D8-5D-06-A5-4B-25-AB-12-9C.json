I believe in me more than anything in this world.\"</p><blockquote><p>\"Don't tell people 'I like to run.' Tell them 'I'm a runner!'</p></blockquote><p>It makes a world of difference! So you are embodying that person or those attributes that you want to have. And then from there, you move forward.</p><p>Because if you say 'I'm moving towards my goal.' Then you're also saying 'I'm not there yet.' But if you embody the end, \u2018I'm already there!\u2019 Right?</p><p>We know you're not holy already there, but you embody the end and then, act as if! And it makes a world of difference. You make so much more progress.</p><blockquote><p>- Joy Dixon\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Check out our friends and sponsor,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/sfelc/Jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a>.
