    "Description": "\n        <p>Triple 8 Management Partner Paul Steele says he\u2019s always been an entrepreneur but is quick to admit that it kind of happened by accident. Diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a young child, Paul chose to channel what he calls his \u201cfidgeting\u201d into entrepreneurial endeavors, like selling his baseball card collections or stamping envelopes for his mother\u2019s real estate business. And once he started working, he never stopped\u2014and he\u2019s logged enough 80+ hour work weeks to prove it . Tune in to hear how Paul went from being homeless (three times!) in college to today heading up one of the fastest-growing music management companies in Nashville.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2KsohfZ\">Triple 8 Management</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2VvdVSE\">Moon River Music Festival</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2xJnkx6\">Magnolia Record Club</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2RqGiiV\">EntreLeadership's Business Health Assessment</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Wd4fwy\">13 Ways to Build a High Performing Remote Team</a>\u00a0from BELAY</p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3cEUWuH\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
