    "Description": "<p>Filled with dread, some math teachers have a problem. As they give problems to students to work their students become problems. Behavior problems. Boredom problems. Sometimes the problem is that students aren't excited by the problems. However, math can be exciting. The \"Open Middle\" math problem format is NOT talking about middle school math, although it applies to middle, high school, elementary, and even college math just the same. Robert Kaplinsky, a math teacher and author on the \"open middle math\" talks about how math teachers can unlock student thinking and interest in how problems are posed to students. Busy math teachers can listen to this quick episode to get an introduction to open middle math and see if they want to dive deeper. Math can be exciting!</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e584\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e584</a>\u00a0</p> Sponsor: The U.S. Toyota Dream Car Art Contest invites youth, ages 4-15, to submit their original hand-drawn artworks that answer the question, \u201cIf you could design a car to make the world a better place, what would it look like?\u201d Artwork submissions for this free youth art contest are accepted this year from November 1, 2019, through January 31, 2020.
