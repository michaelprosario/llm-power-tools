I realized my definition of strategy in my head was not actually strategy and I needed to reframe strategy as being willing to completely blow everything up because there's a bigger, better thing you need to do and I think that if you are very organized and very goal oriented, you don't want to blow up your plan. You want to execute your plan. You're a great executor and that will get you to a certain level. So I think that's inflection point number one, at least it was for me and I think that's true for a lot of people. I see it over and over again.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Kathleen Vignos \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>How the career portfolio concept strategically drives career growth (2:33)</li><li>Surprising discoveries in Kathleen\u2019s transition to tech (5:07)</li><li>Parallels between Kathleen\u2019s early work & current eng leadership (7:12)</li><li>The impact of a career portfolio on acquiring skills in a nonlinear way (10:47)</li><li>Kathleen\u2019s tips for someone reorienting their approach to career growth (15:18)</li><li>Common gaps / blocks people encounter on their career growth journey (17:08)</li><li>Understanding your audience & the reach of your influence (20:13)</li><li>Navigating the shift between being a great executor to a great strategist (22:23)</li><li>Key principles of influencing & facilitation (24:49)</li><li>Strategies for option limiting as a facilitator (27:01)</li><li>How to facilitate to achieve time efficiency & positive option exploration (30:01)</li><li>Applying facilitation strategies during the candidate hiring process (32:39)</li><li>Examples of \u201cpolite interruption\u201d phrases to use (35:31)</li><li>Approaches for dealing with conflict & reframing (36:49)</li><li>Recommendations for negotiating & decision making (39:47)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (44:13)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://gettingmore.com/the-book/\">Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World</a> - Based on Professor Stuart Diamond\u2019s award-winning course at the Wharton Business School, Getting More concludes that finding and valuing the other party\u2019s emotions and perceptions creates far more value than the conventional wisdom of power and logic.
