    "Description": "\n        <p>As a business owner, you are always the ceiling on how successful your business can be. The only way your business can grow is for you to grow. But, there\u2019s a problem: As your company grows and becomes more successful, you\u2019ll be more insulated from candid feedback. There are more people in the mix and there isn't the direct line of feedback that smaller teams can provide. Also, depending on your leadership and the makeup of your team, some of the people who have crucial feedback to share with you might be reluctant to tell you.</p><p>Today, Michael and Megan will share five actions that you can take to get critical feedback through intentional candor meetings.</p><p>The intentional candor meetings held at Full Focus are inspired by the work of Kim Scott and her book, <em>Radical Candor</em>: <a href=\"https://www.radicalcandor.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.radicalcandor.com/</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
