    "Description": "<p>Water is all around us\u2013quite literally, there is enough water in the air we breathe to meet all of humanity\u2019s needs and then some. Engineering professor Cody Friesen invented a solar-powered device that captures this vapor and transforms it into drinking water. Cody began manufacturing these \u2018hydropanels\u2019 with his Arizona-based company <a href=\"https://source.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SOURCE</a> in 2014, and today they\u2019re used in more than 50 countries worldwide.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Cody talks with Guy about the prevalence of water scarcity in the U.S. and around the globe, and his company\u2019s work to become the world\u2019s first renewable, fully-digitized drinking water utility. Plus, the two discuss how entrepreneurs should be thinking about the growing renewable energy market.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
