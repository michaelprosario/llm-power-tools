    "Description": "<p>The tech industry is broken. We deify overworking, and think <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/this-cant-be-normal-the-tech-industry-after-a-year-of-burnout/\">burnout comes with bragging rights</a>. But how do we break this exhausting cycle? In this episode of The New Stack Makers, we talk with <a href=\"https://launchdarkly.com/\">LaunchDarkly</a>'s Manager of Developer Marketing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dparzych\">Dawn Parzych</a> about how to identify burnout in others and in yourself, how to treat it, and how to build a <a href=\"https://aginext.com/a-day-of-organisational-psychological-safety-by-aginext-live/\">psychologically safe working environment</a> that allows folks to say no.</p><p>With a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-parzych/\">masters in psychology</a> and a <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/devrel-and-the-increasing-popularity-of-the-developer-advocate/\">DevRel role</a> that certainly straddles people and tech, Parzych's work often sits on the people side of what they're building.</p><p>\"I love the idea ofthe socio-technical systems that we're building,like tech, doesn't exist in a bubble. People are building the technology. They're very interrelated and you can't just focus on the tech, the people are the hardest part of tech. And we spend more time talking about how tech's the hard piece,where it's reallythe people and the interrelation betweenthe people and the machines,\" she said.</p>\n",
