    "Description": "Tim Lesnick inspires with his take on what 2030 holds for us, who is Omar Atlas, and the value of philanthropy.\u00a0\n\nGiving a shout out to Alec Jones - thanks Alec - that he would introduce me to Tim Lesnick who is the co-owner of Trova Search, a nation-wide recruiting and consulting firm. I now understand why since he has over 20 years in the staffing and consulting industry and placed nearly 4,000 professionals on a contract or full-time basis career path.\u00a0 Tim believes and exemplifies a tenant mindset, called \"Read my mind better\" which translates to \u201cGreat service means mastering the art of anticipation.\u201d I think this would be a great title for a book.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAccording to research by researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), the University of Bamberg, and The Ohio State University objective was to find out whether consciously deciding to have a certain posture can influence a person\u2019s confidence, behavior, and hormone levels. Remember the pose that #Superman or #WonderWoman do?\u00a0 Hands on your hips, feet spread slightly apart, with shoulders back and chest out Tim is a really fun guy and when challenged to join in on power posing he shared another person that had a great power pose, Omar Atlas. Omar was a wrestler that also captured his audience\u2019s attention and favor with his power poses. Be sure to check out Tim channeling Omar Atlas\u2019 power pose for a laugh. Tim\u2019s thoughts? The pose seems awkward except for when doing this with his kids. No judgments, just fun.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s mentoring advice is spot on because it is a challenge for all of us.\u00a0 \n1) Be willing to dig ditches because a lot of people try to take short cuts. \n2) People need experience and don\u2019t know enough about business and put together what they learn in school and it hasn\u2019t been built on experience. And \n3) Give value to more than yourself by giving to others - volunteer and give back through philanthropy work.\nWe hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
