    "Description": "<p>Michael Washington doesn't want AI to write the Great American novel, he wants YOU to write the Great American novel faster and easier. He's created AIStoryBuilders To help you break your stories down into timelines, locations, and characters. He sits down with Scott to talk about how he wrote this application, where retrieval augmented generation comes in, and how he wrote it with web assembly in mind to avoid having to deal with app stores while still having a mobile version.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://aistorybuilders.com/\">https://aistorybuilders.com/</a></li><li><a href=\"https://documentation.aistorybuilders.com/\">https://documentation.aistorybuilders.com/</a></li><li>\u00a0</li></ul>\n",
