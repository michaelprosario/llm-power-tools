    "Description": "<p>What hardware runs Azure today and into the future? While at Build in Seattle, Richard sat down with Rani Borkar to discuss the hardware that makes up Azure Compute, including examples of the new Cobalt and Maia processors! Rani talks about Cobalt first, Microsoft's ARM processor designed for workloads in the cloud. Then, a look at the Maia processor, which focuses on neural net workloads like large language models. As Rani explains, the scale of the work coming to the cloud today allows for specialized hardware - you would likely not want to buy a machine this specialized for yourself, but you can rent it by the minute in Azure!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-compute-blog/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure/ba-p/4146353\">Azure Cobalt Processor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-maia-for-the-era-of-ai-from-silicon-to-software-to-systems/\">Azure Maia</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 22, 2024</p>\n",
