    "Description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Today\u2019s guest, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerjgs404040/'>Roger Hunt,</a> founder of Idea Trek, Inno Ethics, Hoover Dao is interesting because he kicks off the episode strong with his five words that describe him: Open, Trusting, Cantankerous, Intense, and Governed. That last word Governed, stands out.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We discussed how none of us want to be defined by how a person sees us at that one moment in time. Roger is an author and also shares about his new book that will drop at the end of September.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The book is titled, Innovation Ethics, Reframing the Investor Thesis by Roger Hunt and he shares insight as to Destruction Theory and how founders seem to fall under collateral damage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My words, not his.
