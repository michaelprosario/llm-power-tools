    "Description": "<p>By her early thirties, Ava DuVernay was already a successful entrepreneur, having founded her own film publicity agency in Los Angeles. But after years of watching other people make films, she started to get an itch to tell her own stories onscreen. Ava's first films were rooted in deeply personal experiences: growing up with her sisters in Compton, performing Hip Hop at Open Mic Night at the Good Life Caf\u00e9 in L.A. Her self-funded and self-distributed projects began to draw attention, and in 2012, Ava won the award for best directing at the Sundance Film Festival. She went on to direct powerful projects like <em>Selma, 13th, </em>and <em>When They See Us;</em> and through her production and distribution company ARRAY, she's created a movement that is helping change how movies are made\u2014and who gets to make them.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Rachel Faulkner, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Liz Metzger.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter</em></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at <em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
