    "Description": "<p>A relentless hunt for their favorite foods and drinks led Scott and Ally Svenson into launching not one but <em>two</em> multi-million dollar businesses. The first came about in 1990s London when they discovered that British coffee meant <em>instant </em>coffee. So, the Washington natives decided to start the Seattle Coffee Company in the U.K, inspired by their love of Starbucks\u2014which was still only in the U.S. But, once Starbucks started to go global, Scott and Ally decided to sell and move back to Seattle. They soon found themselves looking for quick, affordable, crowd-pleasers to feed their growing boys on busy nights; pizza is a good solution, but it can also be slow and expensive. So Scott and Ally wondered if they could figure out how to make individual, fast-casual pizza work; and they started MOD pizza as a one-store experiment. 15 years and more than 500 locations later, Scott and Ally have their answer: they <em>can </em>make it work.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
