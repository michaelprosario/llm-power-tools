    "Description": "<p>How do you get more from GitHub in your work routine? Richard chats with April Yoho about how sysadmins can take advantage of more GitHub features to make better quality scripts and more! April discusses the capabilities of GitHub Copilot to assist administrators in comprehending the intricacies of source management, including branching and merging. The conversation also delves into extracting more from Copilot itself, including custom instructions and the new agentic mode. Now you can use Copilot to describe a new script and turn it into a series of GitHub issues - and those issues can be assigned to an agentic AI to get the code written!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3454122.3454124\">SPACE Framework</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot\">Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github\">Resolving Merge Conflicts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/04/07/agentMode\">Agent Mode in VS Code</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 20, 2025</p>\n",
