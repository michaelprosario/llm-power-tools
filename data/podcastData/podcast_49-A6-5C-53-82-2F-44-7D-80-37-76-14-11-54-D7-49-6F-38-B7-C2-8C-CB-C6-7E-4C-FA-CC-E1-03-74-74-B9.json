    "Description": "<p>The Internet of Things and Industrial SCADA controls are colliding - what happens next? Richard chats with Niall Merrigan about the security issues around industrial plants - factories, power stations, refineries and so on. There has been automation there for years in the form of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems - but their security models are pretty primitive, often relying on air-gap networks to keep hackers out. Meantime, inexpensive and powerful IoT devices offer new capabilities - they have their own security issues, but there are solutions. What happens when the two meet?</p>\n",
