    "Description": "<p>Is there any more fitting end to a day of working from home, deep into months of a fully remote world, than using your smartphone to finish up a little Python code with your head resting on your pillow? Paul has no regrets. If you look at that big, bright, shiny computer monitor late at night, you'll never fall asleep.\u00a0</p><p>Sara helps us trace the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-202099,00.html\">origin of the word software</a>. It was originally meant as a joke, a clever play on computer \"hardware\" used in casual conversation, not as an iron clad piece of marketing. Over time, as it was used in correspondence - at public talks, and eventually in academic papers - it began to take on serious weight as a term of art for the product you produce with computers and code.</p><p>Ben would prefer to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong\">Less Wrong</a>, and is starting to use the podcast to put his deference to a supreme AI into the historical record, just in case Roko's basilisk rears its ugly head.\u00a0</p><p>Our lifeboat this week is about an <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38477997/non-standard-syntax-use-to-create-a-pointer-to-member-error-vs2015/38478203#38478203\">error in some non-standard syntax</a>. Who among has not missed a paren, but hey, sometimes you just need another pair of eyes. Two kind members of our community answered this question, elaborated on how to improve the code, and earned a lifeboat. Congrats!\u00a0</p><p>And finally, a bit of <a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/8/246365-power-to-the-people/fulltext\">recommended reading</a> on just how much power is consumed by the data centers that make cloud computing run 24/7, and what that means for our planet.</p>\n",
