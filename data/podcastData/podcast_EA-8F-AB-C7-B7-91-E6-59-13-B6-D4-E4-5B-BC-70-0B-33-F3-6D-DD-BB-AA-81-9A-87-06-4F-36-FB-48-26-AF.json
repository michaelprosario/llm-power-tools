    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Colby Fayock. He's a Software Engineer and prolific teacher who has created 68 tutorials for freeCodeCamp, and more than 100 videos on his YouTube \u2013 all freely available.</p> <p>We talk about: - Colby's early days doing design work for local bands - How Colby went to art school, then pivoted that into a software development - His early career at ThinkGeek where he not only did web dev but also worked as a male model for their products. - Colby's day-to-day work as a developer experience engineer, building demo applications and SDKs - How Colby uses AI tools in his day-to-day work, and what he thinks its current limits are.</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1995 punk song.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 9,771 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
