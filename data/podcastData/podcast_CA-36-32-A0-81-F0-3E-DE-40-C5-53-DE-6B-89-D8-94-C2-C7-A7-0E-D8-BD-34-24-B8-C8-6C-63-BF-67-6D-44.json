    "Description": "\n        Leaders are driven to achieve. The problem is that our intense drive can backfire. We sometimes set unrealistic goals or timetables, which are impossible to meet. Not that we don\u2019t kill ourselves trying!\u00a0 When that happens, it\u2019s easy to feel exhausted and discouraged. Why everybody else seem to make rapid progress? Is there a way to get unstuck?\u00a0 There is, and it\u2019s simpler than you might think. Our decades of business experience have taught us this simple principle for making steady progress: Consistency beats intensity, nearly every time. Rather than a big breakthrough, maybe all you need is a simple plan that will bring consistent results.\u00a0 When you begin to think this way, you\u2019ll see dramatic changes in your life and business. You\u2019ll finally escape that feeling that you\u2019re \u201cgetting nowhere.\u201d And you\u2019ll begin to see steady, consistent, gains in your business and personal life.\u00a0 Your Next Step Once you\u2019ve heard this episode, here\u2019s your next step.
