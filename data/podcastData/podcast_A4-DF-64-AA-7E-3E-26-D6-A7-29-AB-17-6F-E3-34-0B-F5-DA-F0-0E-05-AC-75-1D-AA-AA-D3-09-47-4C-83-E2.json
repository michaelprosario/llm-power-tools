    "Description": "Bekah is a mother of four who\u2019s learning to code. But what\u2019s incredible about her story isn\u2019t just that she\u2019s raising young children while finding 2-4 hours every day to code, it\u2019s that she used coding as a form of therapy to get through a very tough time in her life. We\u2019re also introducing a new segment called Tales from the Command Line, and in our first episode, we dig into coding and mental health. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
