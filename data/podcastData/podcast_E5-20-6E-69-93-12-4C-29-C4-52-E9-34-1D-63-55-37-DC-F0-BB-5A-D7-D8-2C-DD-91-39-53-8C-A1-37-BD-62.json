    "Description": "<p>This is the first episode of our new series \u201c<a href=\"https://engineering-founders.simplecast.com/\">Engineering Founders</a>\u201d featuring software pioneer Anna Patterson (Founder & Managing Partner @ Gradient Ventures) who shares with us emerging trends & opportunities in AI/ML! We cover how to spot emerging trends, typical mistakes AI/ML companies & founders make, how product-market fit/scaling is different vs. traditional software companies AND how to test and validate ideas in the early stages. Plus long-time listener Theo Gervet (ML Lead @ Relyance AI) joins us as a guest co-host!</p><h2><strong>ABOUT ANNA PATTERSON</strong></h2><p>Anna is the Founder & Managing Partner at Gradient Ventures, overseeing the fund\u2019s global activities.</p><p>Anna is an accomplished leader in the field of artificial intelligence, a serial entrepreneur, with a long history at Google.

She wrote \u201cWhy writing your own search engine is hard\u201d in the ACM Queue detailing this experience. Prior to that, Anna co-founded and co-authored a search engine Xift.</p><p>Recognized for her technical contributions as well as her commitment to championing women in tech, Anna was awarded the Technical Leadership ABIE Award in 2016. Anna received her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana. Then she became a Research Scientist at Stanford University in Artificial Intelligence, where she worked with Carolyn Talcott and one of the founders of AI, John McCarthy. For her undergrad, she double-majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington University in St Louis.</p><p>Anna resides in the Bay Area, where she wrangles her 4 kids, 2 horses and her Irish husband.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"When you set out your plan, you can't miss all of your sales targets and make all of your hiring targets.\" Those kinds of things have to be inline.</i><br /><i>What people do is they just say, \"Here's my plan. I'm going to march towards the plan. And it was super optimistic on the sales front and on the revenue front. And then maybe more realistic and achievable on the hiring front. And so they still kind of march ahead with the plan.</i><br /><i>I think that you need to constantly reevaluate where you are and on what direction you're going in and whether the growth is appropriate or even the plan was appropriate...\"</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- <i>Anna Patterson</i> \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><strong>Check out our friends and sponsor,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/sfelc/Jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a>.
