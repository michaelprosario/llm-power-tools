    "Description": "<p>Luis Rodr\u00edguez, CTO of\u00a0Xygeni.io, joins host <a href=\"https://se-radio.net/team/robert-blumen/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Robert Blumen</a> for a discussion of the recently thwarted attempt to insert a backdoor in the SSH (Secure Shell) daemon. OpenSSH is a popular implementation of the protocol used in major Linux distributions for authentication over a network. Luis describes how a backdoor in a supporting library was recently discovered and removed before the package was published to stable releases of the Linux distros. The conversation explores the mechanism of the attack through modifying a function table in the runtime; how the attack was inserted during the build; how the attack was carefully staged in a series of modifications to the lz compression library; the nature of \u201cJia Tan,\u201d the entity who committed the changes to the open source project; social engineering that the entity used to gain the trust of the open source community; what forensics indicates about the location of the entity; hypotheses about whether criminal or state actors backed the entity; how the attack was detected; implications for other open source projects; why traditional methods for detecting exploits would not have helped find this; and lessons learned by the community.</p> <p>Brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.computer.org\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IEEE Computer Society</a> and <a href= \"https://www.computer.org/software\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">IEEE Software magazine</a>.</p>",
