    "Description": "<p>In Part 2 of this Two Part podcast, I visit the home of Chris Sells and we make up a topic for the show! I suggested we talk about what programming will look like in 15 years, and Chris countered with the suggestion that we chat about the LAST 15 years first, then the next 15. In this half we speculate on the next fifteen years and what it will bring to personal computing and programming. Be sure to check out Part One!</p>\n",
