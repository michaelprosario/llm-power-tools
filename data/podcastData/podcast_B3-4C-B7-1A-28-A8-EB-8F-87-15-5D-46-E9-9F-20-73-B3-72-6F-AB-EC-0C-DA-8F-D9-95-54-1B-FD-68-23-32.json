    "Description": "<p>Have you wanted to get started with testing in Python? Maybe you feel a little nervous about diving in deeper than just confirming your code runs. What are the tools needed and what would be the next steps to level up your Python testing? This week on the show we have Anthony Shaw to discuss his article on this subject. Anthony is a member of the Real Python team and has written several articles for the site.</p>\n<p>We discuss getting started with built-in Python features for testing and the advantages of a tool like pytest. Anthony talks about his plug-ins for pytest, and we touch on the next level of testing involving continuous integration.</p>\n<p>Anthony recently finished a talk for PyCon 2020 Online, titled &ldquo;Why is Python Slow?&rdquo; He had the idea for the talk while he was working on his upcoming book about the CPython source code. </p>\n<p>I also want to give an update on last weeks episode with Kyle Stratis, where we discussed Kyle being let go from his job due to the pandemic. Here&rsquo;s some good news, Kyle will be joining a Boston startup called Vizit, as a senior data engineer. Congratulations Kyle!</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-print/\">The Python <code>print()</code> Function: Go Beyond the Basics</a></p>\n<p>This course will get you up to speed with using Python <code>print()</code> effectively.
