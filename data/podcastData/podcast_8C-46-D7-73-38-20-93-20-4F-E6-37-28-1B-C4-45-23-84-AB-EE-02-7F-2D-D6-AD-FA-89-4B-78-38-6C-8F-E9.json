    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Head of Data Science and Machine Learning, Michelle Keim. You will hear what working remotely is all about in data science. You will learn about the importance of failure, and why everyone should lose their job at least once. You will hear about churn and segmentation, what they meant 10 years ago and what they mean now. You will also learn about the imposter syndrome and what to do when you feel like an imposter while applying for a role. You will hear about moving from centralized data science teams to integrated experts within the business and leading people on the three key learnings that Michelle has taken away from her experience as a leader.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/299\">www.superdatascience.com/299</a></p>\n      ",
