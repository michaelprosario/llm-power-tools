    "Description": "\n        <p>When Donnel Baird was a child, his parents would regularly use the oven to heat their Brooklyn apartment -- a dangerous and energy-inefficient practice that\u2019s unfortunately not unique to New York City. As an adult traveling the country with the Obama for America campaign, Donnel saw countless homes and apartments wasting power and jeopardizing resident safety because of dated infrastructure. He founded BlocPower in 2014 to address this precise problem, focusing on low-income communities so often overlooked by innovative startups.&nbsp;</p><p>This week on <em>How I Built This </em>Lab, Donnel talks with Guy about BlocPower\u2019s work to modernize buildings nationwide and transition them to clean energy sources. BlocPower has raised more than $100 million from Wall Street and Silicon Valley investors, and has partnered with cities across the country to create greener, safer spaces for their residents.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
