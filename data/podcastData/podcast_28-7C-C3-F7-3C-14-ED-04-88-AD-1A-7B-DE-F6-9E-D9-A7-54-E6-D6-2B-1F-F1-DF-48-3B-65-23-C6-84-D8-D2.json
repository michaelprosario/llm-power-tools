Like no one's going to say, 'No, we don't want data. We just want to function with opinions.' Like nobody's actually going to say that. But that said, getting started on that can be really challenging...</p><p>With anything, you have to go back to what does the business really need. Going back to the revenue drivers and the business pain points that you're going to help solve, whether it's monetizing your data directly or using data as an enablement function to actually help in other areas and so I think getting the organization to understand that data is a product of the business and then sort of working back from there into what does that specifically mean.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Colleen Tartow \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Interested in joining an <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">ELC Peer Group?</a></h2><p>ELCs <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">Peer Groups</a> provide a virtual, curated, and ongoing peer learning opportunity to help you navigate the unknown, uncover solutions and accelerate your learning with a small group of trusted peers.</p><p><strong>Apply to join a peer group HERE:</strong> <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\"><strong>sfelc.com/peerGroups</strong></a></p><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Colleen\u2019s experience building a data program from scratch (2:25)</li><li>What it used to be like building a data engineering team (4:43)</li><li>Narrowing to first principles when hiring for / building a data eng team (6:44)</li><li>Frameworks to advocate for more resources to build your org\u2019s data function (7:53)</li><li>Knowing when you need to transition your data side project to a full data program (10:11)</li><li>Building data teams from a zero to one perspective (13:05)</li><li>What \u201conboarding as discovery\u201d conversations look like (14:38)</li><li>Joining an existing team to implement a defined data-focused function (16:14)</li><li>How to have effective conversations & collaborate with other eng functions (19:19)</li><li>Prioritization strategies when refocusing / creating the data eng org roadmap (21:20)</li><li>How to integrate cross-functional partners into the data eng planning process (22:51)</li><li>The implication of AI on data teams & its intersection with eng teams (24:09)</li><li>Colleen\u2019s decision-making framework (27:54)</li><li>Recommendations for tackling complex data pipelines in different ways (29:27)</li><li>Navigating the paradigm of AI & data eng\u2019s impact on other eng orgs (31:31)</li><li>What the ideal collaboration between data & eng looks like (34:01)</li><li>Recommendations for dealing with points of friction (35:21)</li><li>Steps for aligning data & eng under the same goals (37:16)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (39:04)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60314366\">The Lioness of Boston</a> - Emily Franklin\u2019s deeply evocative novel of the life of Isabella Stewart Gardner, a daring visionary who created an inimitable legacy in American art and transformed the city of Boston itself.</li></ul><h3><strong>This episode wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the help of our incredible production team:</strong></h3><p>Patrick Gallagher - Producer & Co-Host</p><p>Jerry Li - Co-Host</p><p>Noah Olberding - Associate Producer, Audio & Video Editor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/</a></p><p>Dan Overheim - Audio Engineer, Dan\u2019s also an avid 3D printer - <a href=\"https://www.bnd3d.com/\">https://www.bnd3d.com/</a></p><p>Ellie Coggins Angus - Copywriter, Check out her other work at <a href=\"https://elliecoggins.com/about/\">https://elliecoggins.com/about/</a></p>\n",
