    "Description": "  BONUS: X-Matrix and Obeya: How to Make Strategy Visible and Actionable for Everyone with Jim Benson and Karl Scotland <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this BONUS episode, we explore the groundbreaking work of two renowned agilists - Karl Scotland and Jim Benson. Together, they've developed innovative approaches to making strategy accessible and actionable across organizations. We delve into how their combined expertise in X-Matrix strategy deployment and Obeya visualization creates powerful frameworks for aligning teams and keeping strategic conversations alive throughout execution.</p>   The Genesis of Strategic Visualization <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"It's not about whether agile works or not. It's about whether your business is being successful.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karl Scotland shares how his journey from tactical agile practices to strategic thinking began with a deceptively simple question: \"How will we know if this agile thing is working?\" This fundamental inquiry exposed a common gap in organizations - the disconnect between implementation methodologies and measurable business outcomes. Karl explains how this led him to develop the X-Matrix, a powerful visualization tool that connects true north, aspirations, strategies, tactics, and evidence on a single page, creating coherence across organizational efforts.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Jim Benson reflects on his complementary path, observing how organizations often focus intensely on transformations without creating clear alignment between corporate needs, team activities, and customer value. This absence of a \"full story\" connecting strategic intent to daily work leaves teams uncertain if they're actually doing the right things. Jim highlights how their combined approach addresses this critical gap through collaborative strategy development and visual management.</p>   Seeing Strategy, Tactics, and Work in One Place <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Strategy has often been things that C-level people do when they go on a retreat to Cancun...and everybody's like 'why?' and they're like 'Cancun'...the story of how that came about isn't there.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karl and Jim introduce their innovative approaches to making strategy visible and actionable. The X-Matrix provides a powerful framework for capturing the five key elements of strategy (True North, Aspirations, Strategies, Tactics, and Evidence) on a single sheet, showing how these elements correlate. This creates a comprehensive strategic story that answers what an organization is doing, why they're doing it, how they'll know it's working, and what success ultimately looks like.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  This strategic framework then comes to life in the Obeya room, which Jim describes as a physical or virtual space containing a family of visualizations. These include value stream maps, A3s, time series data, personal Kanbans, collaborative problem-solving tools, and KPIs - all designed to support the execution of the strategy articulated in the X-Matrix. By bringing these elements together, teams can maintain a living strategic conversation, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation based on real evidence.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this section, we also refer to:\u00a0</p> <ul style= \"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\"> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://eskokilpi.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/lean-interaction/\"> Esko Kilpi\u2019s Interactive Value Creation blog</a>, where he explores different aspects of value creation, including how conversations are the core interaction pattern.</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> The <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.lean.org/the-lean-post/articles/expanding-the-purpose-of-catchball%EF%BF%BC/\">  Catch-ball process from Lean</a></p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> The <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://availagility.co.uk/2021/03/10/what-is-backbriefing/\"> Backbriefing</a>, From Stephen Bungay\u2019s book <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/41Tpl4Y\"> The Art of Action</a></p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\">\u00a0</li> </ul>   Maintaining Living Strategic Conversations <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"You don't create an annual strategy, but you create a living strategic conversation within the organization.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  The power of connecting X-Matrix and Obeya approaches lies in their ability to catalyze and sustain meaningful strategic conversations. Karl describes the X-Matrix as an \"architecture for your Obeya\" and emphasizes the importance of continuous strategy development rather than static planning. He introduces concepts like \"catch-ball\" from Lean and \"backbriefing\" from military commander Stephen Bungay, which create feedback loops to ensure shared understanding and effective execution.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Jim highlights how this approach transforms strategy from an annual event into an ongoing dialogue where everyone can see how their work connects to larger goals. He emphasizes the importance of choosing language carefully, noting his appreciation for Karl's use of \"evidence\" rather than \"metrics\" - a subtle but significant distinction that encourages learning and psychological safety rather than mere measurement. This creates environments where people feel safe to discuss what's actually happening rather than hiding problems.</p>   The Changing Landscape of Agile and Strategy <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"I want people to own the process themselves, which is the agreements of how they will interact, and then they deploy tools like their Obeya to facilitate that process and those interactions.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  When discussing the recent PMI and Agile Alliance merger, both speakers offer thoughtful perspectives on the evolution of agile methodologies. Jim describes this as part of an ongoing commodification of agile practices, suggesting that we're entering a post-framework era where teams can draw from multiple approaches to craft ways of working that suit their specific context rather than adhering to rigid methodologies.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karl reflects on how the early agile community started with like-minded people coming together to share ideas and be \"heretics,\" but eventually evolved into larger, more commercially-driven conferences and organizations. He sees the future in smaller, more focused communities of practice developing around specific interests or approaches - like the collaboration he and Jim have renewed with their course and strategic visualization work.</p>   Creating Professional Engagement Through Visualization <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"The word 'evidence' is a painfully poignant word... Evidence is something that grows over time based on investigation.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  A fascinating insight from this conversation is Jim's observation about the transformative power of visualization and language in creating psychological safety. He notes that when organizations approach their Kanban or Obeya with a learning mindset - seeking evidence rather than just tracking metrics - the entire conversation changes. Problems become opportunities for learning rather than failures to hide.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karl's careful choice of terminology in his TASTE model (True North, Aspirations, Strategies, Tactics, Evidence) reflects this intention, deliberately moving away from terms like \"annual targets\" or \"process metrics\" to encourage more holistic thinking. This approach helps create environments where strategic conversations can flourish across organizational boundaries, keeping everyone aligned on both direction and progress.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">  About Karl Scotland and Jim Benson</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karl Scotland  is known for his groundbreaking work with the X-Matrix, integrating Agile principles with strategic planning.
