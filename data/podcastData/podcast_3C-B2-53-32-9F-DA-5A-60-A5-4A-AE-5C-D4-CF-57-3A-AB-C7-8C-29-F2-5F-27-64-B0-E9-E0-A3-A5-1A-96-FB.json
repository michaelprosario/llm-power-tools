    "Description": "<p>Without this, developers waste time managing infrastructure instead of focusing on code. VMware addresses this with VCF, a pre-integrated Kubernetes solution that includes components like Harbor, Valero, and Istio, all managed by VMware. While some worry about added complexity from abstraction, Turner dismissed concerns about virtualization overhead, pointing to benchmarks showing 98.3% of bare metal performance for virtualized AI workloads. He emphasized that AI is driving nearly half of Kubernetes deployments, prompting VMware\u2019s partnership with Nvidia to support GPU virtualization.\u00a0</p><p>Turner also highlighted VMware's open source leadership, contributing to major projects and ensuring Kubernetes remains cloud-independent and standards-based. VMware aims to simplify Kubernetes and AI workload management while staying committed to the open ecosystem.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights with VMware\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/has-vmware-finally-caught-up-with-kubernetes/\">Has VMware Finally Caught Up With Kubernetes?</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/vmwares-golden-path/\">VMware\u2019s Golden Path</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
