    "Description": "<p>Felienne is always learning. In exploring her PhD dissertation and her public speaking experience it's clear that she has no intent on stopping! Most recently she's been exploring a large corpus of Scratch programs looking for Code Smells. How do children learn how to code, and when they do, does their code &quot;smell?&quot; Is there something we can do when teaching to promote cleaner, more maintainable code?</p>\n",
