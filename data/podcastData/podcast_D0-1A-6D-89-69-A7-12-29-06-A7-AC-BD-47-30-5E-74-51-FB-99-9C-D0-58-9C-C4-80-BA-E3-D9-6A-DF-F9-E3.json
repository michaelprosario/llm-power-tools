    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with the legend of visual journalism, Alberto Cairo, who talks about understanding if your data is measuring the right thing that you want to be measuring. You will hear about Simpson's paradox and the ecological fallacy. You will learn about the four kinds of literacy, exploratory data analysis versus communicating results, and how to create a narrative structure in your visualization and convey the insights in a certain way so that people can better understand them. And finally, you will hear about ethics in data visualization.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/271\">www.superdatascience.com/271</a></p>\n      ",
