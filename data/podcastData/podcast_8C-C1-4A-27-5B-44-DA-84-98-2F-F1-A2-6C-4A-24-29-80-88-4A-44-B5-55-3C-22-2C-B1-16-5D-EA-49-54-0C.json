    "Description": "<p>Have you wanted to learn Regular Expressions in Python, but don&rsquo;t know where to start? Have you stumbled into the dreaded pink SettingWithCopyWarning in Pandas? This week on the show, we have David Amos from the Real Python team to discuss a recent two-part series on Regex in Python. We also talk about another recent article on the site about views vs copies in Pandas. David also brings a few other articles and projects from the wider Python community for us to discuss.</p>\n<p>David searches for the latest Python news, links, and articles to produce PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly with Dan Bader. <a href=\"https://pycoders.com\">PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly</a> is a free email newsletter for those interested in Python development. Along with the previously mentioned Real Python articles, we also discuss articles from the community about: \ngetting machine learning to production, combining Flask and Vue, space science with Python, and the fastest way to flatten a list in Python.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/reading-and-writing-files-python/\">Reading and Writing Files in Python</a></p>\n<p>This course will get you up to speed with reading and writing files in Python. You\u2019ll cover everything from what a file is made up of, to which libraries can help you along that way. You\u2019ll also take a look at some basic scenarios of file usage as well as some advanced techniques.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:01:40 &ndash; SettingWithCopyWarning in Pandas</li>\n<li>00:06:17 &ndash; Fastest Way to Flaten a List in Python</li>\n<li>00:12:12 &ndash; Combining Flask and Vue</li>\n<li>00:15:33 &ndash; Regular Expressions in Python</li>\n<li>00:23:08 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:24:00 &ndash; Space Science With Python</li>\n<li>00:30:13 &ndash; Getting Machine Learning to Production</li>\n<li>00:37:15 &ndash; genetic-drawing</li>\n<li>00:39:42 &ndash; MicroscoPy</li>\n<li>00:43:55 &ndash; Thanks and Goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/pandas-settingwithcopywarning/\">SettingWithCopyWarning in Pandas: Views vs Copies</a> &ndash; In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn about views and copies in NumPy and Pandas.
