    "Description": "<p>How can modern telemetry solutions help you? While at NDC in Melbourne, Richard chatted with Liz Fong-Jones of Honeycomb about her approach to educating leadership on creating great telemetry solutions for organizations. Liz discusses the importance of being able to answer questions about reliability issues without causing problems, as opposed to relying on a dashboard for every measurement taken of the system. The conversation also delves into the culture of building reliability, where people are encouraged to fail and learn, rather than being punished when things go wrong.</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.honeycomb.io/\">Honeycomb</a></li></ul><p>Recorded April 30, 2025</p>\n",
