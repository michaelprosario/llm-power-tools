    "Description": "<p>Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for building machine learning pipelines. It allows users to author, schedule, and monitor workflows, making it well-suited for tasks such as data management, model training, and deployment. In a discussion on The New Stack Makers, three technologists from Amazon Web Services (AWS) highlighted the improvements and ease of use in Apache Airflow.</p><p>Dennis Ferruzzi, a software developer at AWS, is working on updating Airflow's logging and metrics backend to the OpenTelemetry standard. This update will provide more granular metrics and better visibility into Airflow environments. Niko Oliveria, a senior software development engineer at AWS, focuses on reviewing and merging pull requests as a committer/maintainer for Apache Airflow. He has worked on making Airflow a more pluggable architecture through the implementation of AIP-51.</p><p>Rapha\u00ebl Vandon, also a senior software engineer at AWS, is contributing to performance improvements and leveraging async capabilities in AWS Operators, which enable seamless interactions with AWS. The simplicity of Airflow is attributed to its Python base and the operator ecosystem contributed by companies like AWS, Google, and Databricks. Operators are like building blocks, each designed for a specific task, and can be chained together to create workflows across different cloud providers.</p><p>The latest version, Airflow 2.6, introduces sensors that wait for specific events and notifiers that act based on workflow success or failure. These additions aim to simplify the user experience. Overall, the growing community of contributors continues to enhance Apache Airflow, making it a popular choice for building machine learning pipelines.</p><p>Check out the full article on The New Stack:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-apache-airflow-better-manages-machine-learning-pipelines/\" target=\"_blank\">How Apache Airflow Better Manages Machine Learning Pipelines</a></p>\n",
