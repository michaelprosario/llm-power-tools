    "Description": "<p>The Surface Pro X is thin, light, and is absolutely silent because it has no fans! It uses a power-sipping ARM processor rather than an Intel processor. Jeremy Sinclair schools Scott on why it's significant that Windows can run on ARM now. We'll also learn what this means for developers and tools like Visual Studio Code. Can this ARM machine also emulate x86 processors? Will your next laptop run ARM?</p>\n",
