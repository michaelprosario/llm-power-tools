    "Description": "<p>This episode wasn't supposed to be an episode! I was invited by Jeff Fritz of Twitch fame to talk to his community team of Live Coders on Discord. They recorded it, and mentioned several times that it was useful content! So, why not try something new and make this an episode! Let me know on Twitter if you find my views on community, productivity, and life useful to you!</p><ul><li>http://Livecoders.dev</li><li>http://Github.com/livecoders</li></ul>\n",
