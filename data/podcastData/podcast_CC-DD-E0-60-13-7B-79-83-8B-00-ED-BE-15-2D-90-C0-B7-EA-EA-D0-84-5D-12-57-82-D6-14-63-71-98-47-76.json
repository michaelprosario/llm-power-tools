    "Description": "<p>To be remarkable teachers, we must learn to rise above our problems and bring our best self to the kids. Have you ever struggled to get out of the car to walk into school on Mondays? I have. There have been times I've had trouble getting out of the car to go teach. Teaching is important. It is awesome. But teaching is hard. (If you teach, you don't need me to tell you. You live the struggle.) As for me, I needed this Monday morning pep talk from Todd Nesloney, author of the book <a href= \"http://amzn.to/2lWGUhq\">Kids Deserve It</a>.</p> <p>In today's show Todd and I discuss:</p> <ul> <li>Leaving your stress in the car when you head into school</li> <li>Getting parents excited to receive your phone calls</li> <li>Unleashing student intrinsic motivation</li> <li>How to deal with failure</li> <li>The biggest mistake educators often make when trying to reach struggling kids</li> </ul> <p>A full transcript of this show and the show notes are available at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast\">www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast</a> as well as details on entering this month\u2019s giveaway contests.</p>",
