    "Description": "<p>Dries explains how Drupal began: as a intranet, not internet, message board for his college community. It's now the technology underpinning tens of millions of websites, including some of the biggest in the world.\u00a0</p><p>We get the story behind the name, an accident \u00a0overlap of language that became the software's iconic mascot. And we talk about the process that allowed this to scale from an open source project shared across a few dorm rooms to something used by massive public companies.\u00a0</p><p>Stay tuned Friday, when we'll publish part two of our chat with Dries.</p><p>As always, shout out to our Lifeboat badge winner of the week, for helping to answer the question: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48152008/can-you-use-react-native-to-create-a-desktop-app/48152305#48152305\">Can you use React Native to create a desktop app?</a> As to whether or not you should, well, that's another question for another time.\u00a0</p><p>You can find more about Dries at his <a href=\"https://dri.es/\">website. </a>You can read more about his experience with Acquia <a href=\"https://dri.es/acquia-first-decade-the-founding-story\">here</a>.</p>\n",
