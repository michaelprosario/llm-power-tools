    "Description": "\n        <p> When Madeline Haydon decided to turn her homemade, plant-based coffee creamer into a business, she didn\u2019t fit the mold of a typical founder. She was a woman of color, pregnant with her second child, and had no experience in the food industry. At first, almost all of her sales were through Amazon, and she struggled to convince investors to take a risk on her. But over 10 years, she grew nutpods from a $30,000 Kickstarter campaign into a leading coffee creamer brand, now available in 15,000 stores across the US.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
