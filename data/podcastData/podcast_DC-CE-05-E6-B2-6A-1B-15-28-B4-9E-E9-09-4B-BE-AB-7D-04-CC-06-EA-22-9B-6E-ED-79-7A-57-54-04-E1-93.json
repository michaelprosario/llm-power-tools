    "Description": "\n        <p>Modeling tabular data and spreadsheets doesn\u2019t have to be tedious with CatBoost\u2019s open-source tree-boosting algorithm. CatBoost does what it says on the tin, blending categories with boosting that allows you to train your models faster and handle large datasets for ML tasks across multiple GPUs. In this week\u2019s Five-Minute Friday, host Jon Krohn gets to grips with the technical components of CatBoost that give it the speed and accuracy so acclaimed by its users.<br><br>Additional materials: <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/694\">www.superdatascience.com/694</a><br><br>Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?
