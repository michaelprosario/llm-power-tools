    "Description": "\n        <p>Bayard Winthrop founded American Giant in 2011 with the simple idea to sell clothes made entirely in America at a time when most apparel manufacturing had moved overseas. The first struggle was finding all the components\u2014the cotton, the buttons, the zippers, the rivets; the next was finding people to actually do the work\u2014the dying, the napping, the sewing and the finishing. Once Bayard did all that he ended up with his first product, a plain hooded sweatshirt. But soon after a viral article proclaimed it \u201cthe greatest hoodie ever made\u201d Bayard faced a&nbsp; backlog of orders that took him almost three years to fulfill. Today, American Giant has expanded their line to include all the basics: t-shirts, denim, flannel, and accessories, still entirely produced in the U.S.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
