    "SourceUrl": null,
    "Description": "In 1970, Tom Chappell took out a $5000 loan to launch a natural products company called Tom's of Maine. Working out of a warehouse in Kennebunk, Maine, he created soaps, shampoos, and toothpaste free from added chemicals, and sustainable for the environment. When he sold the company three decades later, Tom's of Maine had become one of the largest natural products brands in the world. PLUS for our postscript \"How You Built That\", we check back with Paul Kaster, who two years ago started a company that makes wooden bowties, and is now starting Carbon Cravat \u2014 which makes bowties out of carbon fiber.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
