You have the benefit of seeing more things, but less deeply and your job is to kind of gather these informations and help other people understand it. People forget, you think you're an engineering leader. You think it's actually about making things. It is, but it's also about translating, especially at scale. You're not making anything anymore. You're enabling other people to make, and in order to do that, you've actually got to be translating and providing context.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Andrew Lau \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a> is trusted by hundreds of tech-led companies across the globe, including Etsy, <a href=\"http://monday.com/\">monday.com</a>, Skyscanner and more to seamlessly orchestrate incident response from start to finish.
