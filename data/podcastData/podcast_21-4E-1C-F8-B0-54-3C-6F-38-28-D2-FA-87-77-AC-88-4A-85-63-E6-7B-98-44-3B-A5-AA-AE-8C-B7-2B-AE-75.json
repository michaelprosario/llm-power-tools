    "Description": "<p>Cloud-native applications provide an advantage in terms of their scalability and velocity. Yet, despite their resiliency, the complexity of these systems has grown as the number of application components continue to increase. Understanding how these components fit together has stretched beyond what can be easily digested, further challenging the ability for organizations to prepare for technical issues that may arise from the system complexities.</p><p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.chaosnative.com/\">ChaosNative hosted</a> its second annual engineering event, <a href=\"https://chaoscarnival.io/\">Chaos Carnival</a> where we discussed the principles of chaos engineering and using them to optimize cloud applications in today\u2019s complex IT systems.</p><p>The panelists for this discussion:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-satchitanand/?originalSubdomain=in\">Karthik Satchitanand</a>, Co-founder and Open-Source Lead, ChaosNative</li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramyamoorthy/?originalSubdomain=in\">Ramya Ramalinga Moorthy</a>, Industrialization Head - Reliability & Resilience Engineering, LTI \u2013 Larsen & Toubro Infotech</li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-d-mach/?originalSubdomain=nl\">Charlotte Mach</a>, Engineering Manager, Container Solutions</li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/norajones1/\">Nora Jones,</a> Founder and CEO, Jeli</li></ul><p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a>, founder and publisher of The New Stack served as the moderator, with the help of Joab Jackson, editor-in-chief of The New Stack.</p>\n",
