    "Description": "<p>JJ came to our attention when we saw a tweet about <a href=\"https://github.com/jjasghar/COBOL-on-k8s\">his work</a> to get an ETL pipeline with COBOL running on Kubernetes.\u00a0</p><p>Elizabeth comes from the world of Linux Systems Administration, but more recently has been working on COBOL and mainframe computing. She tells us that there is actually a cohort of college students actively learning and using COBOL, both for competitions like <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/master-the-mainframe\">Mastering the Mainframe</a>, but also because it's a language that can attract a high paying job at a number of big banks, healthcare providers, and government institutions.\u00a0</p><p>You can find JJ on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjasghar\">here</a> and on <a href=\"https://jjasghar.github.io/\">Github</a> here. Prior to IBM he was a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjasghar/\">partner architect</a> at <a href=\"https://www.chef.io/\">Chef Software</a>.\u00a0</p><p>You can read more about Elizabeth on her website, <a href=\"https://princessleia.com/\">princessleia.com</a>, and yes, we are going to have her back on the podcast in the future to talk about how and when she got that domain name.</p><p>If you're interested in learning COBOL, a ton of resources are available <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/cobol/\">here</a>.</p><p>As always, don't forget about the upcoming charity event, <a href=\"https://devaroundthesun.org/\">DevAroundTheSun</a>, which is bringing together a lot of cool developers for talks and activities, with proceeds going to support those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0</p>\n",
