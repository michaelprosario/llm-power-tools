    "Description": "\n        <p>Every so often, a moment presents itself that demands something out of the ordinary from us as leaders. These singular moments define much more than our businesses or organizations. They define us as leaders, and they define our future. </p> <p>In light of the tragic race-events that are taking place now in our country, we believe this to be one of those pivotal moments. </p> <p>On this podcast, we suspend our usual format to open a discussion about race and what this moment demands of our leadership.</p> <p>Honestly, we have far more questions than answers. We come to the table as learners, and we invite you to join us.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
