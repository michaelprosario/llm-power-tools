    "Description": "<p>In this episode, Hugo Swart from Qualcomm Technologies joins hosts Marc Petit and Patrick Cozzi to discuss Qualcomm's work in XR and the metaverse. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Hugo shares his career journey, starting in wireless technology in the early 2000s during the transition from desktop to mobile computing. He helped develop some of the first standalone VR headsets in 2016 using Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor. Since then, Qualcomm has launched over 80 XR devices using their technology. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Hugo explains Qualcomm's role as an ecosystem enabler, developing the silicon, connectivity, reference designs and tools needed for partners to build XR hardware and software. Key focus areas include perception technologies like tracking and environment understanding, which allow for more immersive experiences. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For the metaverse vision to become reality, Hugo emphasizes the need for open standards and interoperability. He sees the recently announced Meta Quest Pro and Apple Vision AR headsets as validating the market potential. Products like Meta's Quest 3 will help make immersive computing accessible to more consumers. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Hugo remains optimistic that we'll see major advances in AR, VR and MR hardware over the next 2-3 years. While sleek, lightweight AR glasses are still 5+ years away, he sees a path for incremental improvements across smart glasses, mobile AR integration and other form factors in the near term.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>====</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Have any comments or questions? \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Email the show Feedback@Buildingtheopenmetaverse.org Want more information?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Visit our website www.buildingtheopenmetaverse.org</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And make sure you follow us on Linkedin for all of our show updates \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/company/buildingtheopenmetaverse</p>\n<p><p>Have any comments or questions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show Feedback@Buildingtheopenmetaverse.org</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Want more information?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Visit our website www.buildingtheopenmetaverse.org&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And make sure you follow us on Linkedin for all of our show updates&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/company/buildingtheopenmetaverse&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building the Open Metaverse is a podcast hosted by Patrick Cozzi (Cesium) and Marc Petit that invites a broad range of technical experts to share their insights on how the community is building the metaverse together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>#BuildingTheOpenMetaversePodcast #MetaversePodcast #Metaverse</p></p>",
