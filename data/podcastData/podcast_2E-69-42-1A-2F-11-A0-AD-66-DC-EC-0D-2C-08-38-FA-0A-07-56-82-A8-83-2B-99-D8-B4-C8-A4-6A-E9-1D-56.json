    "Description": "<p>As eng leaders, we\u2019re often strapped for resources \u2013 so learning how to advocate for more support is vital. Megan Kacholia, VP of Engineering @ Google, reveals her best strategies when it comes to asking for more resources, removing linchpins / critical points of failure from your eng team, encouraging others to accept changes that will benefit them, knowing when to say \u201cyes\u201d vs. \u201cno\u201d to new responsibilities (and the trade-offs that come with that decision), and navigating challenging situations as a manager.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-k-663abb2/\"><strong>MEGAN KACHOLIA</strong></a></h2><p>Megan Kacholia is a Vice President of Engineering within Google's Core organization.\u00a0 She is a leader in the Cross-Google Engineering (xGE) effort, which is responsible for company-wide technical coordination. Her passion is building effective teams and addressing barriers to help Googlers do their best work.</p><p>Previously, Megan was and VP in Google\u2019s Research organization, where her team\u2019s work spanned machine learning in research as well as production, including products such as TensorFlow, and prior to that she had a long tenure in Google\u2019s Ads organization, where she ran the serving system for Google\u2019s DisplayAds business.\u00a0 Megan has a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UIUC.</p><blockquote><p>\"At the end of the day, we had to be able to explain it to the team. Right? And I can't go and tell the team and be like, 'Well, the opex costs are too high because you know of this reason with the headcount and this and that and I know so and so told you they love you, but really it didn't mean this thing.'</p><p>In some ways, those details don't matter, right? What matters is these people are worried that their project's getting shut down. So when it came time to communicate that we actually were gonna shut it down. We have to do an official shutdown because we have to announce it externally. So that means we have to make sure people only have so many weeks to find a new project and all of these things. So the main thing I emphasize when I talked to them wasn't about like, 'Oh, I did all of this work to try and save your project, and I couldn't.' That was irrelevant. It couldn't be saved.</p><p>The most important thing was about what's the impact for the people? Well, I've already lined up options and positions for every single one.\u201d<br /><br />- Megan Kacholia\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Check out our friends and sponsor,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/sfelc/Jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a></h2><p>To learn more about Jellyfish and how they can help you increase engineering satisfaction and create happier, higher-performing engineering teams.</p><h3><strong>Learn more at</strong> <a href=\"http://jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish.co/elc</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>Join us for one of our in-person community events!</strong></h2><p>That's right!
