Da Vinci was an artist, he was a painter, he was a sculptor, he was an engineer. Breadth, more than depth, is increasingly going to be critical.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Tara Hernandez \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikmeijer1/\"><strong>ERIK MEIJER</strong></a></h2><p>Erik Meijer is a Dutch Computer Scientist, entrepreneur, and AI enthusiast.</p><p>In his long career, he has democratized many academic concepts such as functional programming, reactive programming, and language-integrated query by introducing these concepts into mainstream languages such as C#, Visual Basic, Dart, and Hack, as well as through his startup Apllied Duality Inc.</p><p>As an educator, Erik has shared his knowledge through platforms like Channel 9, Coursera, and edX, enlightening learners worldwide with his courses on reactive and functional programming.</p><p>As the founder of the Probability team at Meta in 2016, he is one of the pioneers in applying AI to programmer productivity and systems efficiency.</p><p>Most recently, Erik is working on providing every knowledge worker with a personal assistant that supercharges their productivity and boosts job satisfaction.</p><blockquote><p>\"I think the engineer of the future will be more like an English major or a music major. Somebody that can really explain their thoughts very well. If you have kids, I would not send them to do computer science. Send them to a liberal arts.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Erik Meijer \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgoldfein/\"><strong>JOCELYN GOLDFEIN</strong></a></h2><p>Jocelyn Goldfein (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jgoldfein\">@jgoldfein</a>) is a Managing Director at Zetta Venture Partners, where she invests seed capital in AI-native startups with B2B business models.</p><p>Jocelyn is a widely recognized industry expert on product strategy, infrastructure, and organizational scale.
