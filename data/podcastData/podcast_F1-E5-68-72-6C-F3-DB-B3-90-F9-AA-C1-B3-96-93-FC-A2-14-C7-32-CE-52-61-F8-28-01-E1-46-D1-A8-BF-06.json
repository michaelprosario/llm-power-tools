    "Description": "<p>In a recent episode of The New Stack Makers, recorded at the Open Source Summit North America, Matt Hartley, Linux support lead at Framework, discusses the importance of the \"right to repair\" movement. This initiative seeks to allow consumers to repair and upgrade their own electronic devices, countering the trend of disposable electronics that contribute to environmental damage. Framework, a company offering modular and customizable laptops, embodies this philosophy by enabling users to replace outdated components easily.</p><p>Hartley, interviewed by Chris Pirillo, highlights how Framework\u2019s approach helps reduce electronic waste, likening obsolete electronics to a form of \"technical debt.\" He shares his personal struggle with old devices, like an ASUS Eee, illustrating the need for repairable technology. Hartley also describes his role in fostering a DIY community, collaborating closely with Fedora Linux maintainers and creating user-friendly support scripts. Framework\u2019s community is actively contributing to the platform, developing new features and hardware integrations.</p><p>The episode underscores the growing momentum of the right to repair movement, advocating for consumer empowerment and environmental sustainability.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about repairing and upgrading devices:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/new-linux-laptops-come-with-right-to-repair-and-more/ \">New Linux Laptops Come with Right-to-Repair and More\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/troubling-tech-trends-the-dark-side-of-ces-2024/ \">Troubling Tech Trends: The Dark Side of CES 2024\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a>\u00a0</p>\n",
