    "Description": "<p>How can Viva Insights improve personal productivity and the productivity of the team? Richard talks to Karoliina Kettukari about the role of Viva Insights - starting with that daily email you likely already get. Karoliina talks about folks using M365 leaving traces of their work and how Insights puts that information to work. Insights help you be more productive by helping you block out time for meaningful work, make sure you follow through on commitments you make, and even identify when you may be working too much. The conversation also explores the management tooling for Insights to help leaders see their team's productivity in the aggregate!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva\">Microsoft Viva</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/insights\">Viva Insights</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/plan-teams-governance\">Goverance for Teams</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 4, 2022</p>\n",
