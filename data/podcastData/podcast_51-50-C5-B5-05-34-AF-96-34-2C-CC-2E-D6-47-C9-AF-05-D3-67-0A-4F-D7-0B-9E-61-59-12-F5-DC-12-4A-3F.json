    "Description": "<p>AI agents hold the promise of continuously testing, scanning, and fixing code for security vulnerabilities, but we're still progressing toward that vision. Startups like Aptori are helping bridge the gap by building AI-powered security engineers for enterprises. Aptori maps an organization\u2019s codebase, APIs, and cloud infrastructure in real time to understand data flows and authorization logic, allowing it to detect and eventually remediate security issues.\u00a0</p><p>At Google Cloud Next, Aptori CEO Sumeet Singh discussed how earlier tools merely alerted developers to issues\u2014often overwhelming them\u2014but newer models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and Claude Sonnet 4 are improving automated code fixes, making them more practical. Singh and co-founder Travis Newhouse previously built AppFormix, which automated OpenStack cloud operations before being acquired by Juniper Networks. Their experiences with slow release cycles due to security bottlenecks inspired Aptori\u2019s focus. While the goal is autonomous agents, Singh emphasizes the need for transparency and deterministic elements in AI tools to ensure trust and reliability in enterprise security workflows.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights in AI application security:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/ai-is-changing-cybersecurity-fast-and-most-analysts-arent-ready/\">AI Is Changing Cybersecurity Fast and Most Analysts Aren\u2019t Ready</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/ai-security-agents-combat-ai-generated-code-risks/\">AI Security Agents Combat AI-Generated Code Risks</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/developers-are-embracing-ai-to-streamline-threat-detection-and-stay-ahead/\">Developers Are Embracing AI To Streamline Threat Detection and Stay Ahead</a></p><p><a>Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a></p>\n",
