    "Description": "<p>Microsoft 365 Data Governance has always been critical - but it's only getting more important!

In the meantime, users are taking advantage of LLMs like ChatGPT for their work whether we want them to or not - so there is a need to act quickly to provide secure capabilities!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Data.
