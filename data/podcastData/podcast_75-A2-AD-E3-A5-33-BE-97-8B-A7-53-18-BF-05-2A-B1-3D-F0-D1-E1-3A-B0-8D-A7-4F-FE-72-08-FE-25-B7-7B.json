    "Description": "<p>This episode of The 10 Minute Teacher was a lot of fun. Not only did I get to interview my principal, Jonathan Dyal, but my film class, the \"Sherwood Showstoppers,\" filmed the interview. (I'm so proud of how much they are learning!) After a tweet I sent out in October 2023, George Couros and Allyson Apsey invited me to write a chapter about Jonathan in their book <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/What-Makes-Great-Principal-Leadership/dp/1948334739?&linkCode=ll1&tag=httpwwwbrighc-20&linkId=72446f4327af29c110f3b4a00f1b64dc&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Makes a Great Principal: The Five Pillars of Effective Leadership</a> out this year. (You can <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/things-that-will-make-a-truly-great-principal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listen to my earlier interview with George</a> about what truly makes a great principal and the five pillars shared in the book.)</p> <p>Principal Dyal shares his philosophy of walking the halls frequently to stay connected with teachers and students, emphasizing his proactive rather than reactive philosophy. We talked about his strategies to build trust with teachers and how he uses observations positively. (I like his philosophy of observations; that is what the tweet was about in the first place.) He also discusses how he builds positive relationships with students in a way that improves student culture.</p> <p>This is a unique interview in that I see this firsthand and know the positive results it has when principals leave their offices, walk the halls, and spend time in classrooms. This approach is powerful, and it works!</p> <p>Show notes and transcript: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e866\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e866</a></p> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection:\u00a0This episode includes some affiliate links.
