    "Description": "<p>Microsoft had a pretty good year in 2016 - or did it? Richard chats with Paul Thurrott about his impressions on Microsoft in the past year with an eye to the future. And while there have been some successes, there have also been some duds in 2016 too. Looking at you, Windows Phone! Paul talks about Microsoft's battles with hardware, from the killing of Band to the problems with Microsoft Surface Book. At the same time, he still loves his Book and is in awe of the Surface Studio. There's lots of great things going on at Microsoft and more to come - have a listen and a great 2017!</p>\n",
