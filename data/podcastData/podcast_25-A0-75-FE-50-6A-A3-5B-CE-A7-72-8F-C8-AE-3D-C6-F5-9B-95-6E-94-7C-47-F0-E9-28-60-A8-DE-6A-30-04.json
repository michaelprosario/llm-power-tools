    "Description": "\n        <p>While the thought of having difficult conversations may fill most of us with dread, business social scientist Joseph Grenny says avoiding conflict is a big mistake. In fact, he says such conversations are absolutely crucial to an organization\u2019s health and overall success. Sure, the stakes are high\u2014and the tension may feel even higher\u2014but ignoring incompetence or bad behavior only creates alienation and a culture of mistrust.
