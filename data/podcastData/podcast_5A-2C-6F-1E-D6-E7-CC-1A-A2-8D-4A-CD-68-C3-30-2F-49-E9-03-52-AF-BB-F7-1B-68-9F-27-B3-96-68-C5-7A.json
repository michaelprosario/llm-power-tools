    "Description": "\n        <p>When Wiliam Wang started selling flat-screen TV\u2019s, he used a winning playbook: partner with an efficient manufacturer, cut out the middlemen, and price your product as low as you can. William used a similar strategy at his first company\u2013making computer monitors\u2013and he built it into a multimillion dollar business. But he wound up mismanaging it into the ground, and spent years working to pay off millions of dollars in debt. After surviving a catastrophic plane crash, William embarked on a new venture, Vizio, and returned to his \u201ccut-out-the-middlemen\u201d playbook to sell one of the world\u2019s first internet-connected televisions. Today, Vizio is one of the top-selling TV\u2019s in the US, and in 2024, sold to Walmart for $2.3 billion.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
