    "Description": "<p>Support us! https://www.patreon.com/mlst</p>\n<p>MLST Discord: https://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5</p>\n<p>Dr. Rapha\u00ebl Milli\u00e8re is the 2020 Robert A. Burt Presidential Scholar in Society and Neuroscience in the Center for Science and Society, and a Lecturer in the Philosophy Department at Columbia University. His research draws from his expertise in philosophy and cognitive science to explore the implications of recent progress in deep learning for models of human cognition, as well as various issues in ethics and aesthetics. He is also investigating what underlies the capacity to represent oneself as oneself at a fundamental level, in humans and non-human animals; as well as the role that self-representation plays in perception, action, and memory. In a world where technology is rapidly advancing, Dr. Milli\u00e8re is striving to gain a better understanding of how artificial neural networks work, and to establish fair and meaningful comparisons between humans and machines in various domains in order to shed light on the implications of artificial intelligence for our lives.</p>\n<p>https://www.raphaelmilliere.com/</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/raphaelmilliere</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here is a version with hesitation sounds like \"um\" removed if you prefer (I didn't notice them personally): https://share.descript.com/view/aGelyTl2xpN</p>\n<p>YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhn6ZtD6XeE</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>Intro to Raphael [00:00:00]</p>\n<p>Intro: Moving Beyond Mimicry in Artificial Intelligence (Raphael Milli\u00e8re) [00:01:18]</p>\n<p>Show Kick off [00:07:10]</p>\n<p>LLMs [00:08:37]</p>\n<p>Semantic Competence/Understanding [00:18:28]</p>\n<p>Forming Analogies/JPG Compression Article [00:30:17]</p>\n<p>Compositional Generalisation [00:37:28]</p>\n<p>Systematicity [00:47:08]</p>\n<p>Language of Thought [00:51:28]</p>\n<p>Bigbench (Conceptual Combinations) [00:57:37]</p>\n<p>Symbol Grounding [01:11:13]</p>\n<p>World Models [01:26:43]</p>\n<p>Theory of Mind [01:30:57]</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Refs (this is truncated, full list on YT video description):</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Moving Beyond Mimicry in Artificial Intelligence (Raphael Milli\u00e8re)</p>\n<p>https://nautil.us/moving-beyond-mimicry-in-artificial-intelligence-238504/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? \ud83e\udd9c (Bender et al)</p>\n<p>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web (Ted Chiang)</p>\n<p>https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Debate Over Understanding in AI's Large Language Models (Melanie Mitchell)</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13966</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Talking About Large Language Models (Murray Shanahan)</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Climbing towards NLU: On Meaning, Form, and Understanding in the Age of Data (Bender)</p>\n<p>https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The symbol grounding problem (Stevan Harnad)</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/html/cs/9906002</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Why the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus is interesting and important for AI (Mitchell)</p>\n<p>https://aiguide.substack.com/p/why-the-abstraction-and-reasoning</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Linguistic relativity (Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis)</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Cooperative principle (Grice's four maxims of conversation - quantity, quality, relation, and manner)</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle</p>\n",
