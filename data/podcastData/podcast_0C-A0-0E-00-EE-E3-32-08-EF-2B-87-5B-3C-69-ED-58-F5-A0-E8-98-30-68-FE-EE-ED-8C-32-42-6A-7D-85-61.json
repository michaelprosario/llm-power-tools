    "Description": "<p>Platform engineering will be a key focus at KubeCon this year, with a special emphasis on AI platforms. Priyanka Sharma, executive director of the Linux Foundation, highlighted the convergence of platform engineering and AI during an interview on The New Stack Makers with Adobe\u2019s Joseph Sandoval. KubeCon will feature talks from experts like Chen Goldberg of CoreWeave and Aparna Sinha of CapitalOne, showcasing how AI workloads will transform platform operations.<br /><br />Sandoval emphasized the growing maturity of platform engineering over the past two to three years, now centered on addressing user needs. He also discussed Adobe's collaboration on CNOE, an open-source initiative for internal developer platforms. The intersection of platform engineering, Kubernetes, cloud-native technologies, and AI raises questions about scaling infrastructure management with AI, potentially improving efficiency and reducing toil for roles like SRE and DevOps. Sharma noted that reference architectures, long requested by the CNCF community, will be highlighted at the event, guiding users without dictating solutions.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Kubernetes:\u00a0</p><p><a>Cloud Native Networking as Kubernetes Starts Its Second Decade</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/primer-how-kubernetes-came-to-be-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/ \">Primer: How Kubernetes Came to Be, What It Is, and Why You Should Care\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-evolution-of-cloud-foundry-with-kubernetes/ \">How Cloud Foundry Has Evolved With Kubernetes\u00a0</a></p><p>Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game. game. https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/</p>\n",
