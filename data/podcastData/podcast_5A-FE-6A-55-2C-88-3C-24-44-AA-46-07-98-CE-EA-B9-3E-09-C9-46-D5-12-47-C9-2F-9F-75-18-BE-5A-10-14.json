    "Description": "<p>This week Jonathan Bennett and <a href= \"https://www.danlynch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Lynch</a> talk with <a href=\"https://siobud.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sean DuBois</a>, one of the few people that seem to really understand WebRTC. He's created Pion, a go implementation of WebRTC, which enables some great tricks like sending TOR traffic through a WebRTC connection. He's also the mind behind some really impressive upcoming OBS features, like direct WebRTC input and output, which among other things enable direct OBS to OBS video connections. Sean also has some words of wisdom about how to make a decent living as an Open Source developer.
