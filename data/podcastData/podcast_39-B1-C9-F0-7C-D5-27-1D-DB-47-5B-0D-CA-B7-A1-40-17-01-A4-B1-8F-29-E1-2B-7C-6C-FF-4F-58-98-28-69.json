    "Description": "<p>OneDrive for Business continues to evolve! Richard chats with Stephen Rose about the announcements around OneDrive for Business at the SharePoint North America conference. Stephen talks about the improved support for photos taken via smartphones, being first-class citizens in OneDrive for Business - including using the amazing Office Len technology to make photos of whiteboards and documents (like receipts) super crisp and clear. The conversation also gets into getting those key 'known' folders moved into OneDrive, so that no given device has unique files, they're always part of the OneDrive for Business ecosystem. Deeper cloud integration everywhere!</p>\n",
