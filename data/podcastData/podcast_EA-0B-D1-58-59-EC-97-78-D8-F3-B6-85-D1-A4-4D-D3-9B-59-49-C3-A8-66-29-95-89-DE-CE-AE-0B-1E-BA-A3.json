    "Description": "<p>Back in April, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-nova/\">Kris N\u00f3va,</a> now principal engineer at GitHub, started <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/build-your-own-decentralized-twitter-part-3-hello-mastodon/\">creating a server on Mastodon</a> as a side project in her basement lab.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Then in late October, Elon Musk bought Twitter for an eye-watering $44 billion, and began cutting thousands of jobs at the social media giant and making changes that alienated longtime users.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And over the next few weeks, usage of N\u00f3va\u2019s hobby site, Hachyderm.io, exploded.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe server started very small,\u201d she said on this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast. \u201cAnd I think like, one of my friends turned into two of my friends turned into 10 of my friends turned into 20 colleagues, and it just so happens, a lot of them were big names in the tech industry. And now all of a sudden, I have 30,000 people I have to babysit.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Though the rate at which new users are joining Hachyderm has slowed down in recent days, N\u00f3va said, it stood at <a href=\"https://grafana.hachyderm.io/public\">more than 38,000 users as of Dec. 20.</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Hachyderm.io is still run by a handful of volunteers, who also handle content moderation. N\u00f3va is now seeking nonprofit status for it with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, with intentions of building a new organization around Hachyderm.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This episode of Makers, hosted by <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/hjoslyn/\">Heather Joslyn,</a> TNS features editor, recounts Hachyderm\u2019s origins and the challenges involved in scaling it as Twitter users from the tech community gravitated to it.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>N\u00f3va and Joslyn were joined by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabemonroy/\">Gabe Monroy,</a> chief product officer at DigitalOcean, which has helped Hachyderm cope with the technical demands of its growth spurt.</p><p><h2>HugOps and Solving Storage Issues</h2></p><p>Suddenly having a social media network to \u201cbabysit\u201d brings numerous challenges, including the technical issues involved in a rapid scale up. Monroy and N\u00f3va worked on Kubernetes projects when both were employed at Microsoft, \u201cso we\u2019re all about that horizontal distribution life.\u201d But the Mastodon application\u2019s structure proved confounding.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere I am operating a Ruby on Rails monolith that's designed to be vertically scaled on a single piece of hardware,\u201d N\u00f3va said. \u201cAnd we're trying to break that apart and run that horizontally across the rack behind me. So we got into a lot of trouble very early on by just taking the service itself and starting to decompose it into microservices.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Storage also rapidly became an issue. \u201cWe had some non-enterprise but consumer-grade SSDs. And we were doing on the order of millions of reads and writes per day, just keeping the Postgres database online. And that was causing cascading failures and cascading outages across our distributed footprint, just because our Postgres service couldn't keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/digitalocean-spaces-mastodon-hachyderm\">DigitalOcean helped with the storage issues;</a> the site now uses a data center in Germany, whose servers DigitalOcean manages. (Previously, its servers had been <a href=\"https://community.hachyderm.io/blog/2022/12/03/leaving-the-basement/\">living in N\u00f3va\u2019s basement lab.</a>)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Monroy, longtime friends with N\u00f3va, was an early Hachyderm user and reached out when he noticed problems on the site, such as when he had difficulty posting videos and noticed other people complaining about similar problems.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is a \u2018success failure\u2019 in the making here, the scale of this is sort of overwhelming,\u201d Monroy said. \u201cSo I just texted N\u00f3va, \u2018Hey, what's going on? Anything I could do to help?\u2019</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn the community, we like to talk about the concept of HugOps, right? When people are having issues on this stuff, you reach out, try and help. You give a hug. And so, that was all I did. N\u00f3va is very crisp and clear: This is what I got going on. These are the issues. These are the areas where you could help.\u201d</p><p><h2>Sustaining \u2018the NPR of Social Media\u2019</h2></p><p>One challenge in particular has nudged N\u00f3va to seek nonprofit status: operating costs.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight now, I'm able to just kind of like eat the cost myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI operate a Twitch stream, and we're taking the proceeds of that and putting it towards operating service.\u201d But that, she\u00a0acknowledges, won\u2019t be sustainable as Hachyderm grows.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe whole goal of it, as far as I'm concerned, is to keep it as sustainable as possible,\u201d N\u00f3va said. \u201cSo that we're not having to offset the operating costs with ads or marketing or product marketing. We can just try to keep it as neutral and, frankly, boring as possible \u2014 the NPR of social media, if you could imagine such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Check out the full episode for more details on how Hachyderm is scaling and plans for its future, and N\u00f3va and Monroy\u2019s thoughts about the status of Twitter.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><hr /></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>Feedback?
