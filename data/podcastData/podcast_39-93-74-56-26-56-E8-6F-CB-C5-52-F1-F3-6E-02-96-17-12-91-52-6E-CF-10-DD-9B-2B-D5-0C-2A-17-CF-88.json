    "Description": "\n        <p>\u201cWho you hang out with determines what you dream about and what you collide with.\u201d - Seth Godin</p><p><br></p><p>Yearning to find community as a Swiss transplant in New York City, Tina Roth-Eisenberg was so moved by these words that she transformed an old office into a fresh co-working space for creatives. From that space, Tina would incubate her would-be biggest project yet: CreativeMornings, an event series that brings local creatives together, which has since grown&nbsp;to over 200 chapters around the world&nbsp;And best of all? It\u2019s totally free to attend.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This week on <em>How I Built This Lab, </em>Tina shared how her design career morphed into an unintentional, yet completely inspired path to entrepreneurship that spawned several successful businesses. Plus, she shares her perspectives on why community and collaboration are key when it comes to building new things.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
