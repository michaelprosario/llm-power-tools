    "Description": "<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the very first episode of <i>We'll Be in Touch</i>, a new podcast series from Stack Overflow.\u00a0</p><p>This show will explore the world of job interviews, career development, and software engineering. Each episode, we'll sit down with folks working in software development to hear their stories, dive into their latest projects, learn about tricky bugs they've tackled, and discuss the tricks they use to keep up with all the latest languages and frameworks.</p><p>Your host, Kyle Mitofsky, is a Staff Software Engineer here at Stack Overflow. With over a decade of experience as an independent contributor, manager, and team leader, he's interviewed a wide range of people and is excited to be able to share these revealing and engaging conversations, WITHOUT the pressure of an actual job interview.</p><p>Whether you're an aspiring developer or a seasoned professional, join us as we delve into meaningful discussions that can help shape your career. We're kicking off the series by chatting with a former colleague of Kyle's, Yaakov Ellis, a long time Stack Overflow community member and employee who currently \u00a0holds a role as a Staff Engineer at Intuit.</p>\n",
