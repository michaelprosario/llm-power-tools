He shares how he tracks team progress, conducts one-on-ones to provide tailored support, and uses subtle nudges to guide the team toward autonomy. Ville emphasizes the importance of understanding where individuals are in their learning journey and helping them achieve their goals by continuously assessing and adjusting support strategies.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  What steps can you take to help your team become more self-sufficient?</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Spider Web Games <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Ville highlights the use of spider web graphs (aka radar graphs) as a way for teams to reflect on their progress in different areas.

By engaging in playful yet insightful activities, teams can foster collaboration and enhance retrospectives.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
