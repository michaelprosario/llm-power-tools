    "Description": "<p>Every experienced software engineer can tell you a story about a standardization effort that ended up causing more problems than it solved. <a href=\"https://petersmagnusson.org/2009/09/15/why-are-there-5280-feet-in-a-mile/\">Queen Elizabeth's decree</a> adding 280 feet to each mile made it easy to divide up acres, but has haunted those of us stuck with Imperial units ever since.\u00a0</p><p>Sara dives into micro frontend services and how they can help to add agility to a modern development team. There is a nice article on the topic <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html\">here</a>, and Sara found it through the Thought Works \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends\">Tech Radar</a>.</p><p>Pinterest paid just under $90 million dollars to <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Pinterest-terminate-SF-office-lease-88-Bluxome-15525421.php\">break its lease in San Francisco</a>. Paul and Sara are hearing about lots of developers who are fleeing major cities, and it seems clear that Pinterest won't be the last company to abandon expansion plans or ditch fancy corporate offices for at least the next few years.\u00a0</p><p>Our lifeboat badge of the week the week goes to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9771397/sravya-nagumalli\">Sravya Nagumalli</a>, who explained why Angular is associated with the Single Page App and just what an SPA is anyway. Thanks for sharing some knowledge, Sravya!</p>\n",
