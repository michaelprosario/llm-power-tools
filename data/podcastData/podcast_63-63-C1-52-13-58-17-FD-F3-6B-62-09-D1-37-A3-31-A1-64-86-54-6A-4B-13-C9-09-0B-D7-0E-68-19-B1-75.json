    "Description": "<p>Welcome back to the freeCodeCamp Podcast.</p> <p>I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org. And I'm bringing you insight from developers, entrepreneurs, and ambitious people getting into tech.</p> <p>It's been 4 years since we published a podcast episode. It's good to be back.</p> <p>This is the first of three interviews I'm publishing this week \u2013 my interview with Danny Thompson. Danny's a bit a legend among career changers.\u00a0</p> <p>He had a kid early in life. For 10 years he worked at a gas station in Tennessee, frying chicken for people to eat. He sometimes worked 80 hour weeks just to provide for his family.</p> <p>And yet, Danny had ambition. He taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp. He built his network through local tech events. And eventually, he landed his first job as as software developer.\u00a0</p> <p>Danny's since worked at tech companies like Google and Front Door, and he's now a software engineer at AutoZone, a major US retail chain.</p> <p>Danny has helped so many people along the way. He's developed a free course on how to leverage LinkedIn as a developer. And he's helped start a ton of local developer meetups.</p> <p>I couldn't dream of a better interview to kick off this new season of the freeCodeCamp podcast.</p> <p>New season. That's right. I've got dozen interviews lined up, and I'm recording these all in-person, in public libraries across Dallas, San Francisco, and New York City.</p> <p>I'm publishing 3 episodes this week, and then a new episode every Friday.</p> <p>We're talking about DevOps, cybersecurity, AI \u2013 tons of topics that I know you're gonna find helpful as you continue to expand your skills.</p> <p>If you dig this podcast, be sure to leave us a review. And tell your friends.</p> <p>Danny on Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev\">https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev</a></p>",
