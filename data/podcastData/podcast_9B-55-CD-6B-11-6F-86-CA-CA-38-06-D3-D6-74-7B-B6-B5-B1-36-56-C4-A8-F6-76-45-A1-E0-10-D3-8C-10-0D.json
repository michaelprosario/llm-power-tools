    "Description": "<p>In this episode, we are talking about adaptability in engineering orgs, building out impactful management systems, and navigating complex transitions as eng leaders with Cosmin Nicolaescu, CTO @ Brex. He shares how his experience moving from Romania to the United States taught him vital lessons in adaptability that he has applied throughout his eng leadership career. We also discuss how to define what success as a manager looks like, Cosmin\u2019s approach to putting out fires (and deciding which ones to prioritize), why you should restructure your meetings to focus on output vs. review, and how to implement a succession plan.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cosminn/\"><strong>COSMIN NICOLAESCU</strong></a></h2><p>Cosmin (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/getCos\">@getCos</a>) leads engineering at Brex, building financial technology to accelerate entrepreneurs. Prior to Brex, he was at Stripe, leading financial infrastructure teams, building Stripe Terminal, and establishing engineering teams globally. His career started at Microsoft, launching Azure and Office365.</p><blockquote><p>\"How are you actually changing the trajectory of something. If the person wasn't there, would things have come out differently? If the person jumped in on something, did that meaningfully change the trajectory of that particular project? The answer should be yes and I think that is a good proxy for, as a manager, are you actually leading teams, people, projects, initiatives, and moving the company forward or are you just operating the machinery?\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Cosmin Nicolaescu \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>We\u2019re less than one week away from <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/glow/?utm_source=elc&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=glow-2024-promo&utm_content=text&utm_term=register\">GLOW 2024</a></h3><p>Attend GLOW 2024 - <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/\">Jellyfish\u2019s</a> virtual summit for engineering, product, and finance leaders who are looking to deliver greater business impact while building great software and teams.
