    "Description": "<p>The challenge of hiring new people into the world of IT is getting harder every day - what does it take to grow your skilled staff? Richard talks with Don Jones about his book Be the Master, where Don focuses on the fact that there are plenty of apprentices out there, but not enough masters to teach them well. And the masters exist - it's just easy to forget that you know things that others don't know, and need to know. The conversation spans around where learning responsibilities lie - it's not going to be the tools vendors like Microsoft, and while organizations that need skilled people need to support learning, ultimately it comes down to us - we need to want to learn and grow!</p>\n",
