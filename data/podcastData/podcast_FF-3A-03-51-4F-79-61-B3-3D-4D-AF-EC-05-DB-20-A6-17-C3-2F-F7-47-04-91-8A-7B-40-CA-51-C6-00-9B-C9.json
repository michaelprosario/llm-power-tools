    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Jack Herrington. As a kid he had to work to overcome Dyslexia and didn't have good enough grades to get into college. Despite this, he's worked as a software engineer for more than 40 years at companies like Nike, Adobe, and Walmart. He also runs the popular Blue Collar Coder YouTube channel.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How Jack struggled with Dyslexia, had terrible grades that couldn't get him into college, but got really into GameDev in the early 1980s</p> <p>- Early developer job opportunities that took his family from his home town in Pennsylvania to Melbourne Australia</p> <p>- How he started blogging as he learned, and ultimately published 6 programming books</p> <p> Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1979 new-wave song.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 10,443 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
