    "Description": "Kristen Smith has spent a lot of time creating just the right spaces for making. In her years working on spaces with Kohl\u2019s, FabCafe, and now littleBits, she\u2019s crafted experiences to get people excited about hardware, and using their creativity in new and innovative ways. We talk about what makes a good makerspace, what the behind-the-scenes of one looks like, and how she leveraged her liberal arts degrees to make the tech world more accessible.
