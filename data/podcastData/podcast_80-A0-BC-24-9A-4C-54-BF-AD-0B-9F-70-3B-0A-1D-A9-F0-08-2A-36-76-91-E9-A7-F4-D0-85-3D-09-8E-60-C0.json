    "Description": "<p>Self-examination and reflection are important parts of improving our teaching practice. With this in mind, Josh Parker encourages us to reflect upon our practice as a teacher with working with a diverse population of students. This show is designed to make us think and open our eyes to mistakes we might be making without realizing it. So, for Thought Leader Thursday, today, we'd like to challenge you to consider if you have areas to improve in your classroom relating to students of a different ethnic background from your own. <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e419\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e419</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Advancement Courses has expertly-crafted classroom courses.
