    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Stacia Misner about the new features of Data Analytics 2012. The conversation starts with the evolution of data analytics from 2000 to 2005, 2008, 2008 R2 and now 2012. Then Stacia digs into how Excel has become the defacto client for analysis services, using PowerPivot and PowerPivot for Sharepoint mode. PowerPivot runs from Excel and doesn't require Analysis Services, at least not at first - but eventually you'll want to bring in the back end. Stacia also explains the evolution of the Unified Dimensional Model (UDM) into the Business Intelligence Seminatic Model (BISM) in Analysis Services 2012. Lots of incentive to upgrade to 2012!</p>\n",
