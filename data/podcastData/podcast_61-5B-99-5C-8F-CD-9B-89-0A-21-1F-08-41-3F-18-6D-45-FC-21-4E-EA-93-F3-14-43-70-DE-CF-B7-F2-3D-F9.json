    "Description": "\n        <p>Forget winning or losing. Bestselling author and leadership expert Simon Sinek says the most important thing is to determine what <em>kind</em> of game you\u2019re playing. For example, baseball is a finite game\u2014a game with known players, fixed rules and an agreed-upon objective. Business, on the other hand, is an infinite game: The rules are changeable, there is no set finish line, and no one wins. And if that isn\u2019t complicated enough, Simon warns that if you approach business with a finite mind-set, the consequences are disastrous. Tune in to learn the five things you need to have in order to prevent disaster and successfully navigate the infinite game of business.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZDrDG6\">The Infinite Game</a></em> by Simon Sinek</p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/34aXxZS\">Simon Sinek's website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2MKTf5W\">Ken Coleman's website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2zx0A0z\">Write a note to Ken</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://apple.co/32925ya\">The Ken Coleman Show</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2jXy188\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
