    "Description": "<p>In the early days, the internet was a decentralized space created by enthusiasts. However, it has since transformed into a centralized, commerce-driven entity dominated by a few major players. The promise of the fediverse, a decentralized social networking concept, offers a refreshing alternative.</p><p>Evan Prodromou, OpenEarth Foundation's director of open technology, has been advocating for decentralized social networks since 2008, starting with his creation, Identi.ca. Unlike Twitter, Identi.ca was open source and federated, allowing independent networks to interconnect.</p><p>Prodromou, a co-author of ActivityPub\u2014the W3C standard for decentralized networking used by platforms like Mastodon\u2014discusses the evolution of the fediverse on The New Stack Makers podcast. He notes that small social networks dwindled to a few giants, such as Twitter and Facebook, which rarely interconnected. The acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk disrupted the established norms, prompting users to reconsider their dependence on centralized platforms.</p><p>The fediverse aims to address these issues by allowing users to maintain relationships across different instances, ensuring a smoother transition between networks. This decentralization fosters community management and better control over social interactions.</p><p>Check out the full podcast episode to explore how tech giants like Meta are engaging with the fediverse and how to join decentralized social networks.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about fediverse:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/fediforum-showcases-new-fediverse-apps-and-developer-network/\">FediForum Showcases New Fediverse Apps and Developer Network</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/one-login-towards-a-single-fediverse-identity-on-activitypub/\">One Login: Towards a Single Fediverse Identity on ActivityPub</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/web-dev-2024-fediverse-ramps-up-more-ai-less-javascript/\">Web Dev 2024: Fediverse Ramps Up, More AI, Less JavaScript</a></p><p>Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game. https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/</p>\n",
