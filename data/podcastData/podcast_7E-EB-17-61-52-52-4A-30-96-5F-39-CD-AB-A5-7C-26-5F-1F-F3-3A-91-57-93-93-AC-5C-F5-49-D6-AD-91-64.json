    "SourceUrl": null,
    "Description": "<p>Brothers Dick and Peter Dreissigacker used their experience as Olympic-level rowers to build a&nbsp;rowing machine that captured the sensation of being on the water. Initially made of bicycle parts in a Vermont barn, the machines had a limited market at first: mostly rowing clubs and schools that competed in the sport. But in the 2000\u2019s, business began to take off when Greg Glassman, the founder of Crossfit, began putting the machines into his gyms. Today Concept2 sells rowing machines to thousands of gyms and teams around the world, plus rowers, stationary bikes and skiing machines for people who train at home.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
