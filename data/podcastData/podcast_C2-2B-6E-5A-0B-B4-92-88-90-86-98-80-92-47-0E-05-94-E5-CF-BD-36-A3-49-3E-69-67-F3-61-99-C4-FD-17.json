    "Description": "<p>In today's Tech Tuesday, I record my screen as I make a custom GPT to evaluate my student websites. This is being released as a podcast and as a YouTube video. First, I make the custom GPT and talk through how that happens. Then, I load it onto my phone and have students take pictures of their web pages and receive feedback on them. This is much faster than you think and is so very useful. When you listen, you'll see how AI can provide a valuable feedback mechanism for student projects, even those with many visual elements and in this case, graphic design needs.</p> <p>Show Notes and Link to YouTube Video: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e841\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e841</a> (link will be live at 7 am EST or you can go to <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com\">www.coolcatteacher.com</a> prior to that time and it will be on the homepage.)</p>",
