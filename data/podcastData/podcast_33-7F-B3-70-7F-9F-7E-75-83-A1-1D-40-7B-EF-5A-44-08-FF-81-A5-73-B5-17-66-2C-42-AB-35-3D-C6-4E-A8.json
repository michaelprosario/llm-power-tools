    "Description": "Emily Xie spends most of her time coding in PHP. But recently, she got a chance to do some making by organizing a laser-cutting class for her Girl Develop It chapter. In our first episode for March Is For Makers, our month-long celebration of everything making, we dig into the differences of software and hardware, and how Emily's software background gave her an interesting perspective on her laser-cutting experience.
