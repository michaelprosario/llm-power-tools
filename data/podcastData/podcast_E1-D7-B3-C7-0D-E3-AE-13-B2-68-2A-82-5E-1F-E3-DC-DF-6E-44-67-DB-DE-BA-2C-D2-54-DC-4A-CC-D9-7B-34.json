    "SourceUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/se-radio/~3/nTG55TQwQYM/",
    "Description": "This episode features a discussion with <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/djg/\">Dan Grossman</a> about an essay paper he wrote for this year's <a href=\"http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2007/\">OOPSLA</a> conference. The paper is about an analogy between garbage collection and transactional memory. In addition to seeing the beauty of the analogy, the discussion also serves as a good introduction to transactional memory (which was mentioned in the <a href=\"http://www.se-radio.net/index.php?post_id=168233\">Goetz/Holmes episode</a>) and - to some extent - to garbage collection.",
