    "Description": "<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between writing code for yourself and developing for others? What new  considerations do you need to take into account as a professional Python developer? This week on the show, we talk to Dane Hillard about his book &ldquo;Practices of the Python Pro&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Dane discusses his philosophy on the design principles that go into writing code. We talk about namespaces, object-oriented design, and how to keep your code extensible. We also consider the how and when of code optimization.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/dicts-arrays-ideal-data-structure/\">Dictionaries and Arrays: Selecting the Ideal Data Structure</a> </p>\n<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll learn about two of Python&rsquo;s data structures: dictionaries and arrays. You&rsquo;ll look at multiple types and classes for both of these and learn which implementations are best for your specific use cases.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:01:29 &ndash; Release and response to Practices of the Python Pro</li>\n<li>00:03:12 &ndash; What was the writing process like?</li>\n<li>00:06:09 &ndash; What makes someone a professional?</li>\n<li>00:12:30 &ndash; How have you and the tools changed in Python testing? </li>\n<li>00:14:10 &ndash; When did you start to see the change in your career?</li>\n<li>00:15:42 &ndash; Sponsor: PyCharm</li>\n<li>00:16:27 &ndash; What topic were you excited to share in the book?</li>\n<li>00:17:49 &ndash; The importance of code design and ergonomics</li>\n<li>00:20:52 &ndash; Why is managing and designing namespaces important?</li>\n<li>00:26:32 &ndash; Expanding that design thought process to object-oriented programming</li>\n<li>00:30:02 &ndash; Differences of functional vs object-oriented programming</li>\n<li>00:34:40 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:36:04 &ndash; What do you mean by extensible?</li>\n<li>00:42:59 &ndash; How and when to optimize code?</li>\n<li>00:45:57 &ndash; Sharing developer philosophy </li>\n<li>00:46:52 &ndash; What are you excited about in the world of Python?</li>\n<li>00:48:31 &ndash; What do you want to learn next?</li>\n<li>00:51:03 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://thepythonpro.com\">Practices of the Python Pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dane.engineering/\">Dane&rsquo;s Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/\">Effective Python Testing With Pytest: Real Python Article</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/\">pytest: helps you write better programs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/effective-python-environment/\">An Effective Python Environment: Making Yourself at Home - Real Python Article</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\">FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django: The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django\">Django: GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/\">Graphene-Django: Provides Abstractions to Add GraphQL Functionality to Your Django Project</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Level up your Python skills with our expert-led courses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/django-portfolio-project/\">Getting Started With Django: Building a Portfolio App</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/test-driven-development-pytest/\">Test-Driven Development With pytest</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/dicts-arrays-ideal-data-structure/\">Dictionaries and Arrays: Selecting the Ideal Data Structure</a></li>\n</ul> <p><a rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://realpython.com/join\">Support the podcast &amp; join our community of Pythonistas</a></p>",
