    "Description": "<p>Are you ready to turn off your last exchange server? Richard talks with Tony Redmond about the recent announcement by Microsoft around management tools for Exchange Hybrid. Tony discusses how organizations that migrated Exchange to Office 365 are stuck with one last server: The server that hosts management tools. The management tools move to a workstation, but they are PowerShell only. And the process of shutting down your last Exchange Server is very much a one-way trip, at least for now. Should you do it? Tony says it's time to get started!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://office365itpros.com/\">Office 365 for IT Pros</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/manage-hybrid-exchange-recipients-with-management-tools\">Retiring Your Last Exchange Server</a></li><li><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/monad-manifesto-the-origin-of-windows-powershell/\">Project Monad</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/fasttrack/eligibility\">FastTrack Eligibity</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/architecture/mailbox-servers/mrs-proxy-endpoint?view=exchserver-2019\">Microsoft Replication Service</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 2, 2022</p>\n",
