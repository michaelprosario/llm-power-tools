    "Description": "<p>Observability is expensive because traditional tools weren\u2019t designed for the complexity and scale of modern cloud-native systems, explains Christine Yen, CEO of Honeycomb.io. Logging tools, while flexible, were optimized for manual, human-scale data reading. This approach struggles with the massive scale of today\u2019s software, making logging slow and resource-intensive. Monitoring tools, with their dashboards and metrics, prioritized speed over flexibility, which doesn\u2019t align with the dynamic nature of containerized microservices. Similarly, traditional APM tools relied on \u201cmagical\u201d setups tailored for consistent application environments like Rails, but they falter in modern polyglot infrastructures with diverse frameworks.</p><p>Additionally, observability costs are rising due to evolving demands from DevOps, platform engineering, and site reliability engineering (SRE). Practices like service-level objectives (SLOs) emphasize end-user experience, pushing teams to track meaningful metrics. However, outdated observability tools often hinder this, forcing teams to cut back on crucial data. Yen highlights the potential of AI and innovations like OpenTelemetry to address these challenges.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest trends in observability:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/honeycomb-ios-austin-parker-opentelemetry-in-depth/\">Honeycomb.io\u2019s Austin\u00a0Parker: OpenTelemetry In-Depth</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/observability-in-2025-opentelemetry-and-ai-to-fill-in-gaps/\">Observability in 2025: OpenTelemetry and AI to Fill In Gaps</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/observability-and-ai-new-connections-at-kubecon/\">Observability and AI: New Connections at KubeCon</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
