    "Description": "<p>In the early 1990\u2019s, Tim League spent $50,000 in savings to lease an abandoned movie theater on the wrong side of the tracks\u2014a shaky experiment that eventually grew into a thriving national chain.&nbsp;As Tim and his wife Karrie built theaters in Austin and beyond, they made a name for themselves by offering dinner with the movie, creative pairings (like sake with <em>Godzilla</em>), and roadshows where movie-goers could watch <em>Deliverance </em>in canoes, or <em>Rocky </em>on the famous steps in Philly.&nbsp;Alamo Drafthouse Cinema now has 40 locations across the country and a revenue of over $300 million, but there have been plenty of bruises along the way: a failed first theater, a fractious lawsuit with business partners, and a swan dive into the red during the pandemic.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves, with music by Ramtin Arablouei</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Carla Esteves.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter</em></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em></a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
