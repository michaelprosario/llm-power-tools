    "Description": "<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to a use a form of version control for data? Something that would allow you to track and version your datasets and models. Well, that&rsquo;s what the tool called DVC is designed to do. This week on the show, David Amos is here and he&rsquo;s brought another batch of PyCoder\u2019s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>David starts with a Real Python article titled, &ldquo;Data Version Control With Python and DVC&rdquo;.  We also cover several other articles and projects from the Python community including: where to get exposure to well-written code, delegation &ndash; composition and inheritance, good Python project ideas for high school students, never run Python in your downloads folder, and more. </p>\n<p>We also have a special guest this week. I talk to Sadie Parker, who recently joined the Real Python team to help create and edit transcripts for all the Real Python video courses. We talk about how to take advantage of all the features this new resource provides. Sadie also discusses how she uses Python to speed up and simplify the editing process. The transcripts and closed captions are now live on the website for all new courses, and we are working through the back catalog.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-zip-function/\">Parallel Iteration With Python&rsquo;s zip() Function</a> </p>\n<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use the Python zip() function to solve common programming problems.
