When I first met Lauren Prager at a Synapse Florida event, I was impressed with her positivity, it was infectious in all the right ways. As I got to know her better I learned more about the organization and how well connected she is to so many resources that everyone in innovation or technology will want to tap into.\u00a0 I have several favorite parts that I believe my listeners will find valuable to hear. Lauren\u2019s mentoring advice is the first nugget, the second is her mantra that she lives her life by, and the third is how we should engage with ethical use of AI.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy the show; please leave us a comment, share the episode and tag a friend to help us grow our fanbase.\u00a0\u00a0\n",
