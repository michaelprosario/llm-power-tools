    "Description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Nick Tune and Jean-Georges Perrin join host Giovanni Asproni to talk about their proposed approach to modernizing legacy systems. The episode starts with some high-level perspective to set context for the approach described in their book, <em>Architecture Modernization</em> (Manning, 2024). From there, the discussion turns to important details, including criteria for deciding which aspects to revisit; some of the activities, processes, and tools; and the importance of data engineering in modernization efforts. Nick and Jean-Georges describe how to successfully implement an architecture-modernization effort, and how to fit that work with the teams' other priorities. The episode finishes with some warnings about the typical risks associated with modernizing a legacy system, and suggestions on how to mitigate them.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><a href= \"https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_source=seradio&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=sept2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This episode is sponsored by QA Wolf.</a></p>",
