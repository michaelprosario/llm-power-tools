You could stay in those stages forever. You can just keep iterating and trying new things, but at some point you have to kind of cut it off. You've got to time box it and just go with something that you know will work. You're constantly also calibrating between the quality of what you're delivering and the time it takes you to deliver it. A lot of that problem backs into this early stage of the process. We do want to do a good job of understanding opportunity but there's analysis paralysis. We don't want to just get stuck there.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Evan Welbourne \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Join us at</strong> <a href=\"https://sfelc.com/annual2024\"><strong>ELC Annual 2024!</strong></a></h2><p>ELC Annual is our 2 day conference bringing together engineering leaders from around the world for a unique experience help you expand your network and empower your leadership & career growth.</p><p>Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to expand your network, gain actionable insights, ignite new ideas, recharge, and accelerate your leadership journey!</p><h3>Secure your ticket at <a href=\"http://sfelc.com/annual2024\">sfelc.com/annual2024</a></h3><p><i>And use the exclusive discount code \"<strong>podcast10</strong>\" (all lowercase) for a 10% discount</i></p><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Staying customer-focused while working toward the future @ Samsara (3:22)</li><li>Merging forward-looking technology & customer-problem-focused product-building conversations (5:54)</li><li>Defining customer success & working backwards from winning (8:38)</li><li>How stage gates can confirm / assess feature accuracy & maturity (10:58)</li><li>What the approval moment looks like while moving from stage to stage (15:29)</li><li>Understanding what stages offer the greatest opportunity for risk / friction (17:11)</li><li>Signals to watch for that allow you to move forward with confidence (19:30)</li><li>Best practices for anticipating & preparing for future possibilities (21:13)</li><li>Using smaller-scale projects to inform future direction of larger-scale products (23:12)</li><li>Communication strategies for working with less technical stakeholders (25:22)</li><li>Methods for effectively communicating complex, technical information (27:59)</li><li>AI / ML team composition at Samsara (30:04)</li><li>Frameworks for aligning & motivating folks to focus on customer needs (32:59)</li><li>Strategies for introducing new technologies & scientific research into your teams (35:06)</li><li>Introducing AI into mission-critical internal tools (36:34)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (39:17)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767248-human-compatible\">Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control</a> - Stuart Russell lays out a new approach to AI that will enable us to coexist successfully with increasingly intelligent machines.</li></ul><h3><strong>This episode wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the help of our incredible production team:</strong></h3><p>Patrick Gallagher - Producer & Co-Host</p><p>Jerry Li - Co-Host</p><p>Noah Olberding - Associate Producer, Audio & Video Editor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/</a></p><p>Dan Overheim - Audio Engineer, Dan\u2019s also an avid 3D printer - <a href=\"https://www.bnd3d.com/\">https://www.bnd3d.com/</a></p><p>Ellie Coggins Angus - Copywriter, Check out her other work at <a href=\"https://elliecoggins.com/about/\">https://elliecoggins.com/about/</a></p>\n",
