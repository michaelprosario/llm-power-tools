    "Description": "<p>Prof. Gennady Pekhimenko (CEO of CentML, UofT) joins us in this *sponsored episode* to dive deep into AI system optimization and enterprise implementation. From NVIDIA's technical leadership model to the rise of open-source AI, Pekhimenko shares insights on bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications. Learn about \"dark silicon,\" GPU utilization challenges in ML workloads, and how modern enterprises can optimize their AI infrastructure. The conversation explores why some companies achieve only 10% GPU efficiency and practical solutions for improving AI system performance. A must-watch for anyone interested in the technical foundations of enterprise AI and hardware optimization.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>CentML offers competitive pricing for GenAI model deployment, with flexible options to suit a wide range of models, from small to large-scale deployments. Cheaper, faster, no commitments, pay as you go, scale massively, simple to setup.
