    "Description": "<p>Craig Culver says that when he opened the first Culver\u2019s restaurant in a small Wisconsin town, there were three cars in the parking lot on a good day \u2013 and two of them were his family\u2019s.&nbsp;Those early years of selling frozen custard and ButterBurgers were hard, but the business was in Craig\u2019s blood. He grew up working in restaurants run by his parents, and Culver\u2019s was a family affair too\u2014one that was more challenging to run than a typical burger joint because of its large menu, with pot roast, soups, and fried fish.&nbsp;The restaurant wasn\u2019t supposed to grow into a behemoth chain, but it franchised quickly, and today there are nearly 900 across the country.&nbsp;On a per-restaurant basis, it\u2019s one of the most profitable quick service restaurants in the country.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
