    "Description": "In our first live broadcast of the podcast, we brought on developers Scott Hanselman and Tiffany Peon to chat about hot topics in the CodeNewbie community. We talked about finding a dev job, code mentorship, and our thoughts on Zed Shaw\u2019s critiques of programming bootcamps. We recorded live on http://twitch.tv/codenewbie, and we loved having you in the chatroom to ask questions, comment, and join us in the conversation. And we\u2019ll definitely do another live edition of Ask CodeNewbie soon. Hope you can join us then! Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
