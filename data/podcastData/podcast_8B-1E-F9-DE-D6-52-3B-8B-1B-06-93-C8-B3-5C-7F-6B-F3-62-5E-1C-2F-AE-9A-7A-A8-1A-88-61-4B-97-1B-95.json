    "Description": "<p>Bob Wise, CEO of Heroku, discussed the impact of generative AI (GenAI) coding tools on software development in a recent episode of The New Stack Makers. He compared the rise of these tools to adding an \"infinite number of interns\" to development teams, noting that while they accelerate code writing, they don't yet simplify testing, deployment, or production operations. Wise likened this to the early days of Kubernetes, which focused on improving operations rather than the frontend experience. He emphasized that Kubernetes' success was due to its focus on easing the operational burden, something current GenAI tools have yet to achieve.</p><p>Heroku, acquired by Salesforce in 2010, is positioned to benefit from these changes by helping teams transition to more automated systems. Wise highlighted Heroku\u2019s strategic bet on Postgres, a database technology that's gaining traction, especially for GenAI workloads. He also discussed Heroku's ongoing migration to Kubernetes, aligning with industry standards to enhance its platform.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Heroku</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-data-stack-journey-lessons-from-architecting-stacks-at-heroku-and-mattermost/\">The Data Stack Journey: Lessons from Architecting Stacks at Heroku and Mattermost</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-and-the-next-generation-of-paas/ \">Kubernetes and the Next Generation of PaaS\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
