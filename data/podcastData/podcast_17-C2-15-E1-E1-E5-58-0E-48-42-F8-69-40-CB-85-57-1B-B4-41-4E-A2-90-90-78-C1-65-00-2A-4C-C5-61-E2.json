Multitudes is focused on software development teams to start, but their bigger vision is to make it easier for any manager to understand and improve their teams\u2019 culture and performance.</p><p>\u201cDevelopers in our audience have expressed skepticism or dismay in the past about software that tracks performance or output,\u201d Lauren explains. Multitudes\u2019 approach is to break down an organization\u2019s approach to ethical team analytics in order to balance delivering value to management with respect and support for the individual developers whose work is being measured. How does that work? <a href=\"https://www.multitudes.co/blog/measure-what-matters-and-dont-be-creepy\">Read Lauren\u2019s blog post</a> about data ethics.</p><p>Lauren founded Multitudes based on insights she acquired running <a href=\"https://www.allyskills.nz/\">Ally Skills NZ</a>, which supports organizations in building equitable, inclusive teams.
