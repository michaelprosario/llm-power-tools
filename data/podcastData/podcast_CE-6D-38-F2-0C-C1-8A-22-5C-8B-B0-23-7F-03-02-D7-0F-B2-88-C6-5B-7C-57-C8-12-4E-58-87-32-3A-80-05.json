    "Description": "<p>Today I'm joined by Malindi Colyer. Among her many skills, she's a Python developer and AI engineer.</p> <p>Malindi grew up on a farm in rural Kansas, in the middle of the US. She trained to become a diplomat, and volunteered overseas. But along the way, she discovered a love of math and computer science. That passion has landed her jobs in New York City, London, and San Francisco.</p> <p>I met up with Malindi in downtown Manhattan to learn all about investment banking, and how she modernized her department at JP Morgan using her software engineering skills. We talk about the high-stakes world of global finance, where she was executing trades sometimes worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p> <p>We also talk about her time as a venture capitalist. She researched thousands of startups to decide which ones her fund should invest in.</p> <p>This is one of the most technical interviews I've done. I've done my best to make Malindi's world of math, AI, and high finance as accessible as I can. I hope you enjoy it.</p> <p>Malindi on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-malindi-colyer-46b95589/\u00a0</p>",
