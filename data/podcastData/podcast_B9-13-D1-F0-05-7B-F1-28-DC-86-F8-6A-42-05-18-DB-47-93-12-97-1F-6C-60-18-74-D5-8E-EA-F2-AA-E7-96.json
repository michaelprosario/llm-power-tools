    "Description": "<p>DeepMind Research Scientist / MIT scholar Dr. Timothy Nguyen discusses his recent paper on understanding transformers through n-gram statistics. Nguyen explains his approach to analyzing transformer behavior using a kind of &quot;template matching&quot; (N-grams), providing insights into how these models process and predict language.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>MLST is sponsored by Brave:</p>\n<p>The Brave Search API covers over 20 billion webpages, built from scratch without Big Tech biases or the recent extortionate price hikes on search API access.

Nguyen concludes by discussing potential future research directions, including attempts to convert descriptions of transformer behavior into explanations of internal mechanisms.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Timothy Nguyen&#39;s earned his B.S. and Ph.D. in mathematics from Caltech and MIT, respectively. He held positions as Research Assistant Professor at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (2011-2014) and Visiting Assistant Professor at Michigan State University (2014-2017). During this time, his research expanded into high-energy physics, focusing on mathematical problems in quantum field theory. His work notably provided a simplified and corrected formulation of perturbative path integrals.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Since 2017, Nguyen has been working in industry, applying his expertise to machine learning. He is currently at DeepMind, where he contributes to both fundamental research and practical applications of deep learning to solve real-world problems.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Refs:</p>\n<p>The Cartesian Cafe</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/@TimothyNguyen</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Understanding Transformers via N-Gram Statistics</p>\n<p>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382204056_Understanding_Transformers_via_N-Gram_Statistics</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC</p>\n<p>00:00:00 Timothy Nguyen&#39;s background</p>\n<p>00:02:50 Paper overview: transformers and n-gram statistics</p>\n<p>00:04:55 Template matching and hash table approach</p>\n<p>00:08:55 Comparing templates to transformer predictions</p>\n<p>00:12:01 Describing vs explaining transformer behavior</p>\n<p>00:15:36 Detecting overfitting without holdout sets</p>\n<p>00:22:47 Curriculum learning in training</p>\n<p>00:26:32 Distance measures in analysis</p>\n<p>00:28:58 Model sizes and training dynamics</p>\n<p>00:30:39 Future research directions</p>\n<p>00:32:06 Conclusion and future topics</p>\n",
