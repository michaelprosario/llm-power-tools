    "Description": "<p>Richard and Greg talk to Brent Ozar from Quest Software about running SQL in the cloud. Part of the conversation focuses on SQL Azure, but Amazon's EC2 running SQL on a virtual machine is also a version of the same concept. The larger topic is really around DBAs providing services to their organizations - because that's what the cloud is offering!</p>\n",
