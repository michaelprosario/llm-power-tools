Each week John Papa and Ward Bell talk to industry experts about their experiences writing, deploying and maintaining web applications in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>And now, here are your hosts, John and Ward.</p>\n<p>0:00:40.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Welcome back to Real Talk JavaScript, this is Episode 11: Accessibility in JavaScript Apps and this week I\u2019ve got my co-host, Dan Wahlin. How\u2019s it going, Dan?</p>\n<p>0:00:48.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Going great, John.</p>\n<p>0:00:49.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> And Dan, today we have a special guest of Jen Luker. How\u2019re you doing, Jen?</p>\n<p>0:00:54.6 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Doing pretty well today. How are you?</p>\n<p>0:00:56.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> We\u2019re doing pretty good, thank you very much. Jen is a Senior Software Engineer at Formidable, BookBytes Podcast co-host, RxJS Learning Team member, and eslint-plugin-react-native-a11y core contributor. Jen has spent a majority of her career as a full stack developer but has a particular fondness for frontend technologies, thus why she\u2019s here today. And she trains others in ReactJS and Accessibility, and enjoys removing obstacles that slow down productivity and loves optimizing webpack builds. When she\u2019s not finding solutions or mentoring others, her spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting. She\u2019s even better known to 3D print her own tools for the job.</p>\n<p>0:01:33.3 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  Nice!</p>\n<p>0:01:34.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Welcome to the show, Jen.</p>\n<p>0:01:35.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Thank you!</p>\n<p>0:01:36.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> There\u2019s a lot in there. I mean, you\u2019re not-</p>\n<p>0:01:37.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Yeah\u2026</p>\n<p>0:01:37.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> Just a JavaScript coder with ReactJS. It looks like you do a lot of teaching, and knitting! That\u2019s pretty cool.</p>\n<p>0:01:44.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Haha, it\u2019s\u2026 I like to say that I\u2019m a knitter first and then a programmer second. So, it\u2019s definitely a large part of my life.</p>\n<p>0:01:53.3 <strong>John Papa</strong> You mean you do something besides coding all day?</p>\n<p>0:01:56.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It happens.</p>\n<p>0:01:56.9 <strong>John Papa &amp; Dan Wahlin</strong> (laughing)</p>\n<p>0:01:58.9 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> You know, I have heard more and more people with knitting now. I, like, I hear that, I also do a lot of training, and I hear that all the time now, so it must be a big upcoming... trend I guess, I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>0:02:11.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I think it has a little more to do with the fact that what we do as developers is often fleeting. It\u2019s something that exists online, it\u2019s not something tangible. Knitting is a programming language that sticks around long enough for you to wear it. So it\u2019s-</p>\n<p>0:02:28.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> I see.</p>\n<p>0:02:30.4 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Definitely caters to those that need that tangible aspect in their lives. But one of the coolest things I\u2019ve seen knitting be used for, not just, you know, cryptography World War II, but also things like using it as a programming simulator for people that don\u2019t have access to computers, such as people in Third World countries. So it\u2019s definitely something that caters to the mind of programmers.</p>\n<p>0:02:56.6 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  Interesting. Yeah, I\u2019ve\u2026 Some of the people, too, have also mentioned it just helps them, it\u2019s very relaxing they said. I don\u2019t know how to knit, I haven\u2019t tried it, but it looks fun.</p>\n<p>0:03:04.3 <strong>John Papa</strong> So now, when we see Dan at his next conference, right before his talk, with a ball of yarn and some needles, we\u2019ll know exactly why that happened.</p>\n<p>0:03:10.7 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  Yeah. I\u2019ll say, \u201cJen inspired me!\u201d</p>\n<p>0:03:13.0 <strong>John Papa &amp; Dan Wahlin</strong>  (laughing)</p>\n<p>0:03:14.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Well, you do know that at React Conf they actually had a fiberarts circle that I ran, so I ended up teaching quite a few people to knit, and crochet, and spin at that conference. So-</p>\n<p>0:03:24.2 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  That\u2019s so cool!</p>\n<p>0:03:25.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It is a possibility.</p>\n<p>0:03:26.3 <strong>John Papa</strong> Huh!</p>\n<p>0:03:26.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  There you go.</p>\n<p>0:03:27.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> That is so cool. Yeah, I think we all have different ways of dealing with non programming mindsets. Like, what do you do when you\u2019re not coding? And some people exercise, some people meditate, some people draw, some people play music, some people knit! So, I think it\u2019s great to have something to kind of work different parts of your brain.</p>\n<p>0:03:47.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Definitely.</p>\n<p>0:03:47.7 <strong>John Papa</strong> Hey, Dan! You had a question for us to kick things off about accessibility.</p>\n<p>0:03:50.7 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  Yeah! So, I think we hear a lot\u2026 I used to work, one of my first jobs out of college was at a government agency and so there it was kind of required to learn about section 508 and things. But with corporations and with a lot of the developers I work with, I\u2019ll have to admit I think we\u2019re a little more in the dark on\u2026</p>\n<p>0:04:11.2 What are some of the ways, like, if I were to say, \u201cHey Jen, what are the key ways from a high level that I could add some accessibility things and like, who can I help with that?\u201d Because I think a lot of us, we think, \u201cOh, well I just add a title to an image and call it a day.\u201d</p>\n<p>0:04:28.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:04:28.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> And I suspect there\u2019s a lot more to it than that.</p>\n<p>0:04:30.6 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> There is a lot more to it but there\u2019s different ways of approaching accessibility on the web. One of the ways is technologically, which is oftentimes what developers deal with, but that\u2019s only 30-50% of the problems you\u2019re going to find in accessibility issues. The other half is going to be content and context and verbiage and language and ways that you say things that make it easier for people that have different disabilities, like neurological issues, or language barriers from interacting with the content on the site.</p>\n<p>0:05:08.5 To deal with the technological side though, I tend to point people towards the aXe, Chrome, and Firefox extensions to begin with because it not only runs like, a technological audit on your site, but it also gives you more information. There\u2019s always links that explain why there\u2019s a problem, why the types of people that you\u2019re focusing when you fix an issue, and different ways that you can fix an issue. So it\u2019s a really great educational tool for just getting started.</p>\n<p>0:05:43.6 <strong>John Papa</strong>  Excellent.</p>\n<p>0:05:44.2 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  Yeah, see, you already hit on a couple things like, you mentioned neurologically how maybe people interpret or have the context for different text. And I actually have a son with some disabilities so I\u2019m very sensitive to this whole, you know, concept. It\u2019s amazing how when you\u2019re not around it, you just don\u2019t think about it. But when you\u2019re around it, it becomes, you know, your whole world. A big deal. So, you know, that\u2019s when I hadn\u2019t ever heard of- Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Is that related to the context you put into, like, the site, then, that helps them understand it better? Or how\u2019s that work?</p>\n<p>0:06:18.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It is. Something that they recommend, or things that I\u2019ve seen regarding recommendations for the level of content does vary depending on who your audience is. If you are a technical journal then chances are you\u2019re going to be catering to a much more technical audience. However, if you\u2019re a generic website you may want to keep your verbiage as low-level as possible, like anything between a third grade level to a high school level education, to allow for people to better understand the words that you\u2019re actually putting on a page, and what the words are trying to tell you.</p>\n<p>0:07:00.0 Like, you\u2019ve got one side where you have people with ADHD that is not going to make it to the end of a 6-paragraph description of what it is you\u2019re supposed to do. And then you have people on the other side of the spectrum that really need step-by-step instructions of what it is they need to do to get through your form. So trying to find that happy medium, or trying to find a way of giving a TLDR and then a longer context for different sides of that issue, is also something you may want to look at.</p>\n<p>0:07:31.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  Interesting, yeah. I\u2019ll have to admit that\u2019s something that I haven\u2019t really, you know, you mentioned third grade through, maybe, high school level and I think, as developers, we, especially if we\u2019re in charge of putting some of the content, you know, out there ourselves, that\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really thought through as to, you know, who\u2019s my target that\u2019s going to be reading this? As far as, you know, you think of, \u201cI know these words and I\u2019m sure everyone else will know these words.\u201d But it sounds like you\u2019re a lot better off if you can kind of reign that in a little bit, make it more focused.</p>\n<p>0:08:02.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Something that I\u2019ve found that\u2019s extremely different for even a dev when they\u2019re onboarding into a new company is learning the names of things, and learning the acronyms for things. So if you\u2019re using customized names for your products or your processes or you\u2019re using acronyms, then you\u2019re already losing part of your audience who just doesn\u2019t understand what those things mean.</p>\n<p>0:08:28.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> So, I think that\u2019s a great point. This isn\u2019t just for accessibility for, even for people like, let\u2019s just say vision-impaired on one side. This is for anybody who doesn\u2019t necessarily know your vernacular.</p>\n<p>0:08:38.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Exactly.</p>\n<p>0:08:39.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> You go to a new company, what\u2019s the first thing they do? \u201cHey, today we\u2019re going to use the TLC with the EBY and then we\u2019re going to talk with the XJ Bots.\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201c...What does any of that actually mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>0:08:49.4 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I recently onboarded with a company and someone was very nice enough to put together a cheat sheet of acronyms for me and it was five pages long.</p>\n<p>0:08:57.5 <strong>John Papa</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:08:58.0 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong>  Wow! (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:08:59.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> When I went to Disney one of my first things they did, like my first week there, was I got a book like that, too.</p>\n<p>0:09:05.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:09:05.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> And the funny thing at Disney was the every TLA, which is a three-letter acronym which is kind of funny, the first letter of all of them begin with D for &quot;Disney&quot;. Which really-</p>\n<p>0:09:14.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p>0:09:13.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> Only left two letters for all the rest. (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:09:16.8 <strong>ALL</strong> (laughing)</p>\n<p>0:09:17.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> I don't know if it's changed since then though. (laughs) But let's, let's start back. So on that same note, there's something I've seen a lot of over the years, and when I first encountered this, it's not an acronym but it's an abbreviation, I didn't know what the heck it meant. But, and maybe there's other people in the same boat so I wanted to talk about it with you. A-11-Y.</p>\n<p>0:09:39.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p>0:09:40.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Can you explain what that is and why people see that?</p>\n<p>0:09:42.6 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> So back in the days of Twitter when there were only 140 characters, writing out a really long word like &quot;accessibility&quot; which is 13 letter long, took up a lot of space. So due to Twitter and their awesome audience, they shortened it to A11Y which is A-, the first letter in &quot;accessibility&quot;, 11 letters, and then Y-, the last letter in &quot;accessibility.&quot; You see the same thing with &quot;Kubernetes&quot; with K8S, or &quot;internationalization&quot; which is I18N. So any of those really long words end up getting shortened to first letter, number of characters in between first and last letter, and last letter.</p>\n<p>0:10:26.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, that's... that's kind of funny, you know? Once I realized that, I started going, &quot;You know, I've been using I18N for years and I didn't know why it was called that.&quot;</p>\n<p>0:10:33.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:10:33.2 <strong>John Papa</strong> Until I discovered it through A11Y, 'cause we, our nickname for it when we were talking about it was &quot;ally&quot;.</p>\n<p>0:10:39.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Which I think is highly appropriate.</p>\n<p>0:10:40.7 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, yep. It kind of is a...</p>\n<p>0:10:42.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> It fits it.</p>\n<p>0:10:43.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> It kinda worked for us, too.</p>\n<p>0:10:44.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p>0:10:45.3 <strong>John Papa</strong> So, Dan, you're really D1N and Jen, you're J1n. It doesn't really work for our short first names, does it?</p>\n<p>0:10:50.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin &amp; Jen Luker</strong> (laughing)</p>\n<p>0:10:52.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Well, Jen is already shortened.</p>\n<p>0:10:53.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, yeah. It doesn't really help. What if your name is Al? What do you do? You only have two letters.</p>\n<p>0:10:58.4 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah, there you're out of luck.</p>\n<p>0:10:59.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> First and last.</p>\n<p>0:11:01.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> A0L I guess? AOL! There you go! That's what AOL stood for.</p>\n<p>0:11:05.4 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Al.</p>\n<p>0:11:06.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> The secret has been revealed, right here.</p>\n<p>0:11:07.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Who knew?</p>\n<p>0:11:08.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:11:09.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> (laughs) So accessibility. One of the things I think that was really eye-opening to me was understanding how many people this actually affects. When I first started getting into it many years ago on some large projects the things that were introduced to me were,&quot;Well, we're doing this because there are, you know, millions of people who are affected by this and we're really trying to make the web more accessible.&quot; You know, it sounds like a grandiose thing, but that was true. We were trying to make our websites more accessible to all these people who either couldn't use our websites, or they could but with much difficulty.</p>\n<p>0:11:43.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Right.</p>\n<p>0:11:43.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> Now, what kind of scale is this really at? Is it just one guy down the street? Or is it, you know? How big is this?</p>\n<p>0:11:48.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Well the World Health Organization estimates that about 15% of the entire world has some sort of disability. This is a highly conservative number. Not everyone wants to identify with the fact that they have a disability. There's definitely a level of taboo that comes with the word &quot;disability.&quot; So-</p>\n<p>0:12:13.3 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yep, I can vouch for that.</p>\n<p>0:12:15.6 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Right? So there's a lot of people that will not identify with that label and therefore the 15% is, in fact, a very limited number. You know, if you're looking just in the U.S. they estimate, as of the 2012 census so it's been a while, 19% of people, so almost 1 in 5. If you're looking at other numbers we're looking at 8% of you men who are colorblind of some fashion, and it's not an on and off switch, there's a varying degree. There's also people with multiple versions of color blindness. There are people with very slight color blindness so it's almost unnoticeable. The range is quite large and about 1% of women also are colorblind. So you're looking at about 4.5% of the population as a whole just for one type of disability.</p>\n<p>0:13:10.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> That's fascinating, and it hits, at part for me, that's at home, too. 'Cause I also identify as being partially colorblind, I guess you could say. I'm on that scale.</p>\n<p>0:13:19.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:13:20.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> I don't have full blown color blindness because I can still determine some colors but others I have struggles with.</p>\n<p>0:13:25.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:13:26.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> But I've also found that when I identify with this I get a lot of backlash from people of, &quot;Well you're not really colorblind.&quot; Or, you know, there's a lot of disbelief. It's almost like it's become, &quot;Oh, I'm sorry.&quot; So I can totally empathize with you on why people wouldn't want to identify with any of these things \u2018cause it's almost like they put them in a category of, &quot;Oh, well... the pity category.&quot;</p>\n<p>0:13:48.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Right? And there's differences in color blindness. It's not just grayscale in everything. There's the red/green, there's blue/green, there's you know, the trichotomy side, there's... there's a lot of different variations, and then there's some people that can see the differences between but the colors are all still muted. The more muted they are the less likely you're going to be able to tell the difference between them which really starts to rear its ugly head when you're looking at images or text color changes. So, it gets complicated fast.</p>\n<p>0:14:25.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> Is this the real answer to what color that dress is on the internet streams?</p>\n<p>0:14:29.6 <strong>ALL</strong> (laughing)</p>\n<p>0:14:31.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Oh my gosh.</p>\n<p>0:14:32.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> That's a whole other fascinating concept-</p>\n<p>0:14:34.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:14:34.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> When it comes to how each person perceives color-</p>\n<p>0:14:39.2 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah. That was-</p>\n<p>0:14:39.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> And how no one actually perceives them the same way.</p>\n<p>0:14:41.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> That was pretty freaky, actually.</p>\n<p>0:14:42.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, I know. (laughs) Yeah, I get that a lot from folks on, themes for example. I like to create themes for VS Code or for other tools and when you create a theme people get very personal over what theme they choose. And the reason I created my own is because I like mine to look the way I look and it makes me feel good, it makes me more productive, but not everybody likes one theme. There's probably, you know, 100 great themes out there. It's because everybody looks at things differently and they have varying degrees of sensitivity to the colors, too.</p>\n<p>0:15:14.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:15:14.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> So, you're building an app and you have to pull accessibility in. What kind of apps should use accessibility?</p>\n<p>0:15:21.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> All of them.</p>\n<p>0:15:22.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Good answer. (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:15:23.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah, it's a good one. I was gonna say, &quot;Great answer.&quot;</p>\n<p>0:15:24.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:15:25.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> What does it cost for money? I mean, I a business manager now. Does it cost more money? How much more time is it going to take? Do I need to teach my people how to build web apps for accessibility? What kind of things are affected by it? I don't have time for this, no, let's not do it. I bet you've heard all these things?</p>\n<p>0:15:40.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Oh yeah! Absolutely.</p>\n<p>0:15:41.7 <strong>John Papa</strong> How do you answer those?</p>\n<p>0:15:42.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Well, there's a couple different ways. The not so passive-aggressive way is to find the person closest to them that's colorblind and then sit them down and say, &quot;Can you explain to them why we're not going to write the website in a way that they can use it? This person in that company that works for you.&quot; That tends to drop, you know, that tends to pull up some people's shorts.</p>\n<p>0:16:06.6 But the other ways is you can start talking about those financials. If you're looking at the return on investment take those 15% of the population. If you are, you know, a $10 million company, by making your website accessible it's an $11.5 million company, and that's just your slice of the 15%. Only 1 in 10 websites is accessible, which means you still have the opportunity to corner the market in your region, your demographic. That means that that 15% could very well be larger than the rest of the people that use your website.</p>\n<p>0:16:53.4 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> That's an interesting concept from a, you know, purely financial standpoint. I\u2019d never even thought about that, even cornering your own market.</p>\n<p>0:17:00.1 <strong>John Papa</strong> And that's what a lot of people make decisions on, right? If you're gonna make more money, it's still making- Think like a business manager. You're telling me my $10 million app I can pull in $11.5 million instead; an extra 1.5 million a year, which is, pick some fake numbers for a minute.</p>\n<p>0:17:13.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:17:14.5<strong>John Papa</strong> What's the cost though? Of building that app, what's the additional cost?</p>\n<p>0:17:18.7 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> If you're designing it from the ground up it's very little additional cost. So a lot of the major issues have to do with color contrasts. Other ones have to do with making sure, you know, as you've said before, title tags on HTML or hrefs or ALT tags on images. A lot of it has to do with the fact that the platform, HTML, is inherently accessible and we, as JavaScript developers, go ahead and run through and override it and make it inaccessible. So, sticking closer to the platform is usually enough to cover the majority of accessibility issues.</p>\n<p>0:18:03.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> Let's take a quick break for a word from our sponsors.</p>\n<p>0:18:05.8 <strong>Voiceover</strong> Looking to learn more about the state of software security?

Jen, you were just talking about how you can stick to the platform and that might help you build accessible apps. Can you kind of explain what you mean by that?</p>\n<p>0:18:55.4 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I usually mean by using semantic HTML as much as possible for the reasons it's made. For instance there's a lot of... A lot of developers that still would rather use a div over a button, but the complexities inmaking a div accessible like a button go deeper than you'd expect. So it's not just adding a highlight, adding text or a keyboard interaction. It's also weird things like, in some versions of ios, if you don't add a cursor pointer in the CSS, ios won't detect that it's a link, even if you tell it that it is.</p>\n<p>0:19:39.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Hmm. That's interesting.</p>\n<p>0:19:40.0 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah, I don't think I've run into that, myself.</p>\n<p>0:19:42.5 <strong>John Papa</strong> Oh, we hear about semantic HTML a lot, right Dan? About, &quot;Don't use divs everywhere!&quot; But yet, I don't know about you, but a lot of apps I get called in to look at it's like, div craziness.</p>\n<p>0:19:52.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:19:53.2 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> I call it div soup.</p>\n<p>0:19:54.7 <strong>John Papa</strong> (laughs) Div soup!</p>\n<p>0:19:55.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:19:56.4 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah. How much, so Jen, are there numbers out there, and I'm sure there are, for people- 'cause I know probably the only program I've heard of would be for people with vision, you know, various issues from they're completely blind to partially. How many different apps are out there? What, is there a number one app that you use to actually read these pages to them? Like, I've heard &quot;JAWS&quot;, is that still a thing these days?</p>\n<p>0:20:21.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> JAWS is definitely a huge things, particularly for windows systems. Other screen readers would be just the default screen reader that Mac uses. Chrome has its own that you can implement, too. There's a dozen major, major players.</p>\n<p>0:20:44.0 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Okay.</p>\n<p>0:20:46.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> So, and not all of them, just like the browsers, read the text or the website in the same way. Even ios and android devices have different readers of their own. So, each one kind of reads things a little bit differently. It's important to be aware of those differences once you start really digging deep into accessibility, especially if you're trying to customize something away from semantic HTML.</p>\n<p>0:21:13.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Now does, you mentioned, I mean, the thing that I think most developers probably have heard of are title attributes, and like you mentioned, the ALT on images, things like that. One that probably most people have come across, and you're going to have to correct me if I say this wrong, I've already said &quot;ARIA?&quot; [pronounced are-ee-uh]</p>\n<p>0:21:30.7 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:21:31.3 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Is it ARIA [pronounced are-ee-uh] or ARIA [pronounced air-ee-uh?] Is it ARIA [pronounced are-ee-uh]?</p>\n<p>0:21:32.6 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I call it ARIA [pronounced are-ee-uh]. It's WAI-ARIA [pronounced why-are-ee-uh].</p>\n<p>0:21:34.2 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Okay then. I'm going with you then. So, okay. See, I'm right, everyone!</p>\n<p>0:21:38.6 <strong>John Papa &amp; Jen Luker</strong> (laughing)</p>\n<p>0:21:39.3 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> 'Cause Jen says!</p>\n<p>0:21:40.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Ha!</p>\n<p>0:21:42.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Now that's one I've only seen a few of the, I guess you could say core attributes that you can do with ARIA, but do those play a, I would assume, a pretty big role then? With some of the screen readers out there?</p>\n<p>0:21:54.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Yes and no. Going back to semantic HTML, if you're using just HTML then there's really no need for the ARIA roles. The roles themselves are built in to the platform-specific HTML; however, if you are deviating from that plan or you are using something a little closer to HTML5 then ARIA can play a role in making sure that exactly what you want read to a screen reader is defined. So, usually the first rule of ARIA is &quot;Don't use ARIA.&quot; But there's definitely a place for it.</p>\n<p>0:22:40.9 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Okay, good to know. Yeah. I think that's one area that, you know, I'm comfortable with the semantic tags and it's good to hear that those are still the, kind of, I guess, goal.</p>\n<p>0:22:51.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:22:52.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> But I'm not as familiar with the ARIA stuff. You know, you'll see it, for instance, even in some of the, if you use Bootstrap all, the CSS.</p>\n<p>0:22:59.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:22:59.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> I've noticed they'll add it here and there. If you use Font Awesome I've noticed there'll even be some ARIA-type stuff. But kind of one of those where you copy and paste it and don't really know what it does, you know, without looking it up more.</p>\n<p>0:23:10.5<strong>John Papa</strong> You bring up a great point there with Font Awesome, Dan. Font Awesome, if my memory serves me right, you take a icon tag, right? The i and then you almost always have to stick in an ARIA attribute into there because you're effectively making a button, sometimes, out of that. So you're making a button out of an icon, which isn't really a button, and maybe you don't want it to be inside of a button control. Which almost always leads to end up using the ARIA attributes on there. Is that a bad thing, Jen? Or is that, I mean, 'cause that's what I see a lot out there. I mean, just 'cause I see it doesn't mean that it's right.</p>\n<p>0:23:45.7 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> For the most part what you want in a button is text; however, we often use icons for those buttons. If you can possibly wrap it in a button control that would be better than just trying to add ARIA items to the icon itself. However, that is a way to get around that. Ideally you'd add a button, you'd tell the button its title and its value and that's what ends up getting read instead of just an empty icon.</p>\n<p>0:24:20.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, I hear you. Ideally, I try to do that as well, and I'm actually trying to pull up some code of where I've done this before to kind of get sense for, you know, &quot;Why did I do that as opposed to actually using a button, in that case?\u201d And I think sometimes it's more about styling and maybe it's just about effort. Like, you could put it inside of a button. If you didn't really want it to look like a button you could then restyle the button so it didn't look that way.</p>\n<p>0:24:44.7 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It is so easy to restyle a button-</p>\n<p>0:24:48.1 <strong>John Papa</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:24:47.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> So that it doesn't actually look like a button.</p>\n<p>0:24:49.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p>0:24:49.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It is so easy. It's like three lines of CSS and suddenly it's just your icon.</p>\n<p>0:24:55.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> I think you're right on that. I mean, and that's actually gets back to a thing of, Daniel you'll laugh at this, it makes me think of Silverlight. (laughs) The old Silverlight days.</p>\n<p>0:25:04.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs) Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:25:05.3 <strong>John Papa</strong> Where everything was described as a lookless control. And I kind of wish, in some ways, HTML was like that.</p>\n<p>0:25:11.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p>0:25:12.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> Whereas, out of the box, a button has a certain look and a feel. I wish it didn't. Like, you had to add those things because I feel like because there already is a standard way these things are represented... Like, you stick a button on a page you get a certain look, and it's almost never exactly what you want it to look like anyway. So maybe if there was a lookless feel to these HTML elements-</p>\n<p>0:25:32.6 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Or at least an option for that, right?</p>\n<p>0:25:34.7 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah!</p>\n<p>0:25:35.0 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Where if you want it out of the box, great. But if you don't, here's how you can start from scratch and just add your own CSS in. Which wouldn't be too bad because we typically use, especially for public facing, you know, reset-type CSS, stylesheets anyway. So you could just kind of say, &quot;Nope. Start from scratch and here's what I'm using.&quot;</p>\n<p>0:25:52.3 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p>0:25:52.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:25:53.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> But on that topic, Jen. Is, you know, for your... You obviously specialize in this and I saw in some of the info John was sharing with me that you worked on a website that implemented some automated accessibility testing to meet, is it WCAG? Is that how you say the standard there?</p>\n<p>0:26:10.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p>0:26:11.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> WCAG 2.0? Okay.</p>\n<p>0:26:12.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:26:13.4 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Can you tell us more about, kind of that process? And what you need to do there?</p>\n<p>0:26:17.6 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I actually worked on the Starbucks Careers Site project that was recently released. The benefit of that project is that when they started with a rewrite they started from design up with the intention to comply with WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility. So it was literally baked in from the design up and everybody was on board with engineering it to be as accessible as possible. So it was very much a collaborative effort between the design team, the different developers that worked on it, and even the engineering managers and the product owners. It was a really great process.</p>\n<p>0:27:05.2 As far as the testing goes, we actually went through a few different layers of testing. The very first one is we implemented the eslint-jsx... or the eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y ... ESLint plugin. That (laughs)-</p>\n<p>0:27:24.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> Oh, sorry, wait. Just let me make sure I got that one right. It's the eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, right?</p>\n<p>0:27:30.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Yes!</p>\n<p>0:27:31.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> Okay. Perfect. (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:27:32.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Say that 10 times fast.</p>\n<p>0:27:33.7 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I know.</p>\n<p>0:27:34.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> Exactly.</p>\n<p>0:27:34.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It's really long. Especially when you start talking about the fact that I wrote another one for React Native. So...</p>\n<p>0:27:39.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:27:40.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It's even longer. That was kind of the first line of defense. It was utilized right there with Prettier, which was great. We used husky to run Prettier and the accessibility linter at the same time before someone could push code to the repo. In addition to that, we moved on to using axe-core as implemented into Jest for unit testing. And then we also use axe-core in Enzyme for end-to-end testing once the content was compiled down to static pages.</p>\n<p>0:28:26.4 So this allowed us to hit the developers before they even pushed, hit the unit test of each one to make sure that they would comply if given the ideal data, and then made sure that it was still compliant once the data from the APIs was inserted into the page on a real time level.</p>\n<p>0:28:52.2 That essentially meant that at every step of the process we made sure that everything was compliant before it made it to live.</p>\n<p>0:29:02.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Excellent. This would be public, I guess, right? Is this where people would go to look for a job? Or... is that what it was? It says the careers website, it looks like.</p>\n<p>0:29:10.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Yes, it was actually the... Yeah, it's just Starbucks.com/Careers.</p>\n<p>0:29:14.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> Okay.</p>\n<p>0:29:15.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It was multiple pages, it had its own menu navigation. Once you actually go to look for a job by submitting your resume and stuff, you're transported out to the portal that they use, which we didn't get to go over, but the careers section of the Starbucks.com website is, in fact, accessible. And they're using those to expand that project.</p>\n<p>0:29:43.4<strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> For people that want to learn more about it learn more about it, obviously I guess you could go right click view source on, you know, the careers site, but is there a recommended site that it out there that's considered a really good, almost like cheat sheet of how to get started adding stuff into your site?</p>\n<p>0:29:59.5 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> There is. WCAG 2.0 website.</p>\n<p>0:30:03.1<strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Okay.</p>\n<p>0:30:03.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Which we will add to the show notes for this. It is on W3's website. That's usually a great place to go dig in and find out what's kind of covered in compliance. If you dig in deep enough you can find examples of how to implement code in an accessible way. They give different formats of how you could implement a menu, different ways of, you know, drop downs, so they do give you examples that would comply with accessibility compliance that I've found isn't always exactly going to suit your needs but gives you a very good idea of what's going to be necessary.</p>\n<p>0:30:46.5 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Okay. And is there, when it comes to, you know, if I'm vision-impaired, as a, from developer standpoint is there a way to really test that? Short of using like JAWS or maybe one of the built in readers you mentioned? Or is there an actual tool out there than can help you, you know, make sure that what you wanted them to hear is actually what gets heard?</p>\n<p>0:31:08.0 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> It's literally manually testing at that point.</p>\n<p>0:31:10.8 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Okay, I kinda figured. But, yeah I'm wondering if there's anything out there.</p>\n<p>0:31:14.4 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Something I do want to mention about that is when you are dealing with testing screen readers, among other different types of ... you know, accessibility technologies, assistive technologies that help you. Being cold, not knowing them, and going in and trying to test them actually develops a huge amount of frustration. That can actually develop enough frustration that you decide that it's not even worth it for someone else to have to try to deal with this pain even with something is ideal.</p>\n<p>0:31:52.0 What you should do is find someone who uses that technology day in and day out. You'll be amazed at how much faster and much easier they navigate through tools. And something that I have found extremely interesting is how they've learned to adapt their interactivity with your site based on how it's already broken. So it can be very fascinating to see how people that interact with it have their actual pain points, which things aren't, and those aren't things that you're going to be able to identify as just a casual user.</p>\n<p>0:32:28.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> Let's take a quick break for a word from our sponsors.</p>\n<p>0:32:32.0 <strong>Voiceover</strong> Are you building a web application? Need to deliver it soon and don\u2019t have the people to do it? Maybe you\u2019re not sure your company has the skillset or experience to do it. Then maybe we can help.</p>\n<p>0:32:42.4 I\u2019m your host, Ward Bell, and my day job is building applications for companies like yours. I don\u2019t do it alone, I\u2019m president of IdeaBlade, a consultancy that specializes in enterprise web application development. We\u2019re particularly strong in Angular, RxJS, NgRx Redux on the frontend, and .Net Microsoft technologies on the server.</p>\n<p>0:33:03.2 We\u2019re a small tight knit group of people, hand picked by me, for their expertise, experience,integrity, and team spirit. Maybe we can help you with architectural guidance and hands-on development. And if there\u2019s something we don\u2019t know (and in our field, really, there\u2019s too much to know), we can draw on our personal connections in the Microsoft RD, MVP, and Google GDE Networks as well as our international circle of really great developers, people we know and trust personally.</p>\n<p>0:33:29.8 If you\u2019ve got a project that\u2019s keeping you up at night shoot us an email at info@ideablade.com. That\u2019s info@IdeaBlade.com. And now back to the show!</p>\n<p>0:33:42.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> And we\u2019re back. Jen, Dan brought up a good question \u2018cause I had this same thought, and I know it\u2019s changed throughout the years, too; it\u2019s how do you test for your site being accessible, and I realize, you know, the manual test is the best one. But there\u2019s, and you do some automating as well for this. I noticed you mentioned the eslint plugin that you had.</p>\n<p>0:34:01.5 Years ago there was, well it still exists, a Chrome plugin for screen reader which is now labeled as deprecated, and I notice they always link you over to the Lighthouse tools now, the Chrome plugin for that, which does an accessibility audit. I don\u2019t know how you feel but I\u2019m curious, like on, I see for example, the Starbucks Careers site has a, right now, 100 out of 100 score for accessibility. That doesn\u2019t make me feel like it\u2019s done, but it does make me feel like at least, like if there were something missing in that list of what wasn\u2019t 100, I\u2019d know I have some work to do. But when it\u2019s 100 I\u2019m then stuck with the, \u201cWhat\u2019s my next step?\u201d Like, running Lighthouse step one: make sure those things aren\u2019t barking at you.</p>\n<p>0:34:44.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:34:45.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> But what do you do after that?</p>\n<p>0:34:47.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> After that is when you starting bringing in actually user testers. So previously we were talking about return on investments of adding accessibility features from the viewpoint of someone who wants to add the accessibility demographic, right? The addition of adding those accessibility features actually expands far beyond those with accessibility issues, but also everybody. So, for instance, say that you\u2019re sitting in a really noisy bar and you want to share a video with your friends. You can\u2019t just sit there and play the video and expect them to get everything that\u2019s being said. It\u2019s too loud in the area that you\u2019re in. With either a transcript or subtitles you can actually understand everything that\u2019s going on in the video without having sound.</p>\n<p>0:35:39.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> I\u2019m so glad you brought that up \u2018cause that\u2019s something that is near and dear to me on videos. Not just for people who have issues, but it\u2019s also\u2026 Just think about the financial side of this, too, and the marketing side. If you want somebody to watch your video and it\u2019s scrolling past them on a screen in a Twitter feed, or Linkedin, or Instagram, or any kind of social media even, or even on the TV. If there\u2019s no sound, if they can see the words sometimes that grabs their attention.</p>\n<p>0:36:08.0 And I\u2019ll, gonna share something about myself here, when I watch TV shows, and I love science fiction, things like Game of Thrones for example-</p>\n<p>0:36:17.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:36:17.5 <strong>John Papa</strong> I actually put the closed captions on because I can\u2019t tell what the heck name they\u2019re saying.</p>\n<p>0:36:21.7 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> I do the same thing.</p>\n<p>0:36:23.0 <strong>John Papa</strong> You know? (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:36:23.4 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Not with Game of Thrones but with other stuff, yeah.</p>\n<p>0:36:25.8 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, I mean if their name was \u201cDan\u201d I could get it. But when some of these names comes on I\u2019m like, \u201c...\u201d So I love the fact that we\u2026 It\u2019s not just for people who can\u2019t understand names like me, but it\u2019s a great thing for videos \u2018cause now you\u2019re reading an audience who maybe they don\u2019t understand the slang you\u2019re using, maybe English isn\u2019t their first language. If you\u2019re recording in English.</p>\n<p>0:36:46.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:36:47.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> So when I talk with other countries they use the closed captions a lot for trying to figure out, \u201cWhat did John say?\u201d There\u2019s just so many good ways and good reasons to do it and it\u2019s not hard.</p>\n<p>0:36:58.4 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Unh-unh (negative).  It\u2019s not necessarily hard but it is time consuming. And it can be a little bit costly, depending on whether you do it yourself or whether you\u2019re hiring someone to-</p>\n<p>0:37:08.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p>0:37:09.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Provide those transcriptions for you.</p>\n<p>0:37:11.3 <strong>John Papa</strong> There are some free ones. Like if you go to YouTube and you upload it they give you one free translation, but then you run the risk of something like, my good buddy, Asim Hussain, his name is spelled A-S-I-M.</p>\n<p>0:37:22.9 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>0:37:23.4 <strong>John Papa</strong> And when he recorded one of the videos it came out on the closed captioning as \u201cHello, everyone. My name is Awesome Hussein.\u201d</p>\n<p>0:37:29.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:37:30.2 <strong>ALL</strong> (laughing)</p>\n<p>0:37:31.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> We should call him that now, when I see him.</p>\n<p>0:37:32.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yes! So that\u2019s now his nickname. (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:37:34.6 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> That\u2019s awesome. Ha ha!</p>\n<p>0:37:35.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> Literally!</p>\n<p>0:37:38.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Oh, goodness. Yeah, YouTube is\u2026 I\u2019m so proud of YouTube for at least trying to add like, automated transcriptions to all of the videos that are available. So there is a button you can click on that will show just a real time transcription as it\u2019s developed. Unfortunately our ability to write machine learning that can fully understand different accents, different dialects, different contexts is still lagging behind how quickly communication and language evolves. So it\u2019s not the best. It\u2019s like trying to use Google Translate and it can be difficult.</p>\n<p>0:38:23.3 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s- I started playing with, so Azure has it, and Amazon has had it though, for quite a while, has a few more voices at this point on AWS, but they have a service on some of my, I guess you could say wordier posts, meaning that there\u2019s not as much code \u2018cause it\u2019s hard to convert.</p>\n<p>0:38:43.0 This is kinda opposite of what we\u2019re talking about, this is text-to-speech, and I said, you know, it doesn\u2019t really cost me. I mean, it\u2019s negligible, almost free it\u2019s so minimally used by people and looking at the stats, but it\u2019s you know, Amazon Polly and then Azure\u2026 I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called. what\u2019s it called, John? They have their text-to-speech service. Do you know off the top of your head? I don\u2019t think I remember the name. It\u2019s probably part of the cognitive speech APIs I\u2019m guessing.</p>\n<p>0:39:12.9 But anyway it'll, you know, take your text and convert it into like, an mp3. So I\u2019ve been doing that recently on just some of my more text based posts. \u2018Case like I said, it\u2019s hard to get context out of code, of course. But, you know, I like having it. I look at the stats. There\u2019s not a ton of usage, per se. Although somebody could download it, almost like a podcast, but what I like about it is somebody that, you know, was vision impaired in some way, and I swear the older I get I\u2019m starting to fall into that category anyway where I\u2019d almost rather listen to it, you know, than read it.</p>\n<p>0:39:49.4 But there\u2019s a lot of different things out there like that that I think as technology progresses, you know, hopefully as you\u2019ve mentioned, Jen, the YouTube closed captioning-type thing just keeps getting better and better. Text to speech is definitely getting pretty awesome. The voice I picked I\u2019m just amazed with how high the quality is. So, a lot of cool stuff out there for this.</p>\n<p>0:40:08.2 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, that is called Azure\u2019s text-to-speech cognitive services is the piece of it. You\u2019re right it\u2019s Amazon Polly. I put both those links in the show notes for everybody.</p>\n<p>0:40:16.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I think the biggest take away from all of this is that accessibility isn\u2019t just for the people with disabilities. It literally is for everyone and it\u2019s not just for old people or young people or people suffering from a specific disability. It\u2019s also for people that have temporary or circumstantial disabilities. It\u2019s for people that have you know, issues today, but no issues tomorrow. Or maybe they\u2019re watching a TV show that has really loud explosions and really quiet text and your baby\u2019s sleeping-</p>\n<p>0:40:52.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> Yeah, what\u2019s up with that anyway?</p>\n<p>0:40:53.8 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs) Right? That\u2019s why I use a screen\u2026 You know, that\u2019s why I use subtitles. But, you know, it\u2019s just the more you step back and look at it the more you realize that accessibility isn\u2019t just keyboard tabbing and it\u2019s not just a screen reader. It\u2019s being able to allow people to interact with your content no matter who they are, or where they are, or what they are; and that has a real power.</p>\n<p>0:41:22.9 That has the ability to take people that, I mean, arguably needs to be the ones that have the work flexibility in order to support themselves, and to be able to have the insurance to take care of their medical issues, and give them a job that gives them that freedom. I mean we, as devs, have a huge amount of freedom. We can work from anywhere as long as we\u2019ve got an internet connection and a laptop. And as long as we\u2019re working towards making the entire web accessible, whether that\u2019s Game of Thrones, or that\u2019s our technological documentation it really opens up the world to people that would not have otherwise had the opportunity to be able to make the best of it.</p>\n<p>0:42:10.9 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Absolutely. I think that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s just a win all around for everyone. To kind of tag on that again, real quick\u2026 So I was at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, which if you\u2019re in the United States listening to this you\u2019ll probably know who that is, they\u2019re a pretty big sporting goods company. But I was out there doing some angular training and we were talking briefly- Jen, that\u2019s why I asked more about the ARIA labels \u2018cause that\u2019s came up. And they actually have a full-time, at least one person maybe more but at least one I know full-time for accessibility.</p>\n<p>0:42:41.0 So I think kind of challenge we might be able to issue all of us as devs is, if your company\u2019s currently not doing that, there are companies that are. Now, you know, some of them I think are doing it purely out of what you just said, Jen. They just want to make it more accessible to everybody. Some of them probably it\u2019s financial and okay, I think it\u2019s a win either way, whatever they choose.</p>\n<p>0:43:02.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> Sure.</p>\n<p>0:43:03.1 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> But I think that\u2019s a challenge we could all probably take on to try to be a little more educated on that and use it more.</p>\n<p>0:43:09.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> there\u2019s even little things you can do that may not fall under the exact category but how many times have you been to a website where there\u2019s so much text jammed onto a screen you can\u2019t actually discern what you\u2019re supposed to be looking at? You know, so just making sites easier to read and having a better user experience. I find user experience and accessibility really flow together, personally. And when you\u2019ve got one and the other together it\u2019s like the beauty of the web. When you have neither of those that\u2019s like when you go back to one of those 1996 websites where you can't figure out what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p>0:43:42.2 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> (laughs) It\u2019s absolutely true. It\u2019s definitely a situation where making it fantastic for one group of people ends up helping everyone. So I mean, even if you do one thing today, if you add one more ALT tag, or you convert one more div to a button, or one button to a link, you know? That\u2019s one more thing that\u2019s going to be useable. You don\u2019t have to flip the switch and have your entire website accessible tomorrow, but you can make one step today.</p>\n<p>0:44:13.9 <strong>John Papa</strong> Awesome. Jen, we would like to wrap up this show with a section we call \u201cSomeone to Follow\u201d where we talk about somebody who may be well known, or may not in the industry who we just want people to take a closer look at. And I\u2019ll kick things off. Today, and I seem to be picking names that I can\u2019t pronounce recently, so I apologize Gleb, but the person I want to point out is Gleb Bahmutov, and it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019ll put his Twitter link up here on the page. He is one of the JavaScript ninjas behind the tool called cyprus.io which, Dan you did a show with us on that a couple of weeks or months ago.</p>\n<p>0:44:47.6 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> I love it. Yeah.</p>\n<p>0:44:49.1 <strong>John Papa</strong> Gleb is amazing. I\u2019ve talked with him a few times on, he\u2019s another Twitter friend, and the reason I wanted to call him out was I was working with cyprus.io, \u2018cause I switched, Dan convinced me to switch. And I absolutely loved it and I was trying to solve some problems with it and I resent it to him on Twitter and he helped me get over those issues right away. And I just really love how open and friendly he was and he\u2019s just done some amazing technology products that he\u2019s had on the web over the years and cyprus io is just the recent one of those. Dan, do you have somebody to follow?</p>\n<p>0:45:20.4 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> Yeah. So I had the chance to have dinner recently with one of my buddies, Rick Strahl. You know Rick, John.</p>\n<p>0:45:27.6 <strong>John Papa</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p>0:45:28.3 <strong>Dan Wahlin</strong> And for those that don\u2019t know Rick he\u2019s like, world champion I think. He windsurfs a lot (laughs). But Rick\u2019s just a all-around very cool guy and very knowledgeable about frontend and backend type technologies, so he\u2019s @Rick- We\u2019ll put it in the show notes, but @RickStrahl on Twitter.</p>\n<p>0:45:51.7 <strong>John Papa</strong> And Jen, do you have someone to follow?</p>\n<p>0:45:53.1 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> I do. So there\u2019s someone that I\u2019ve been seeing a lot in the conference circuit this year. His name is Tejas Kumar. He is one of the nicest, most upbeat, most enthusiastic, and kindest, and most patient people you will ever meet in your entire life. He has more energy than my child and he\u2019s basically the person who touts love and tolerance and kindness throughout Twitter. It\u2019s a definite highlight in my feed. So I will definitely include his link in the show notes as well. But he\u2019s my person to follow.</p>\n<p>0:46:34.2 <strong>John Papa</strong> Actually I think I met Tejas last week at dotJS in Paris. Super nice guy. I hadn\u2019t met him before but he was just a Twitter friend, so. It\u2019s so nice when you actually meet people in person who you meet on the internet. (laughs)</p>\n<p>0:46:46.0<strong>Jen Luker</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n<p>0:46:47.1<strong>John Papa</strong> Well hey, Jen, it was great having you on here and thank you for coming on and talking to us about accessibility and for everybody who\u2019s listening, thanks for listening to this show. We\u2019re putting a bunch of links in the show notes so go check those out and please listen to us every Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>0:47:03.3 <strong>Jen Luker</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p>(Exit Music)</p>\n<p>0:47:08.4 <strong>Voiceover</strong> Thanks for listening to Real Talk JavaScript.
