Previously on the 10-Minute Teacher, guests have mentioned Book Creator as one of their top apps for the iPad. Well, now we can all use Book Creator in our classrooms using the Chrome web browser. Make books, send the link to parents and even include audio and video. As a teacher, you can get started with a library of 40 books as part of their free version - go to <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/bookcreator\">coolcatteacher.com/bookcreator</a> to get started now. This is great news! Now we can all use Book Creator in our classrooms, on any device, using the Chrome web browser. (This tool would be perfect for following the techniques described in today's show.)</p>",
