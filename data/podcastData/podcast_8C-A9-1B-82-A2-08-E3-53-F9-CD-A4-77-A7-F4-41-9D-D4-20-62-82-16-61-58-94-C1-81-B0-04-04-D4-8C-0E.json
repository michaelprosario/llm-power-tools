    "Description": "<p>Here come the acronyms! Richard chats with Cameron Fuller about Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS), the cloud-based instrumentation, diagnostics and automation tool from Microsoft that is all the rage - and not just for cloud related products! Cameron talks about being able to feed any kind of log data into OMS for analysis. The conversation then turns to the on-premises System Center Operations Manager and its role in providing deep analytics into specific Microsoft products, and able to push that data to OMS for a comprehensive view. All these products work together!</p>\n",
