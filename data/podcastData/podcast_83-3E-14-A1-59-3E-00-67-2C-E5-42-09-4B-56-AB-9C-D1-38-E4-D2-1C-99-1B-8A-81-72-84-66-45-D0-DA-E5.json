    "Description": "\n        <p>Good leaders want to do the right thing. But sometimes we can be our own worst enemy. Have you ever made a really dumb choice that cost you a relationship or an opportunity? </p> <p>It\u2019s so discouraging to realize you\u2019ve made an avoidable mistake. It can even make you question your decision making ability. </p> <p>But you <em>can</em> recover. </p> <p>When we see people who seem to always make the best decision, it\u2019s tempting to believe that they\u2019re just smarter than we are, or maybe have a unique gift. Not true! Nobody is born wise. </p> <p>The good news is that wisdom is a trait you can acquire. </p> <p>Over a lifetime of practice (and the mistakes to go with it) we\u2019ve distilled our learning into <em>3 habits</em> that wise leaders consistently practice. </p> <p>Put these habits to work for you, and you\u2019ll begin to see a huge difference. You\u2019ll avoid the regret and disappointment that come with repeated failure. Your decision making will improve, you\u2019ll make better choices, and you\u2019ll become the respected leader you aspire to be. </p>  <p>Once you\u2019ve listened to this episode, ask yourself this key question: \u201cIn what area of my leadership am I most reluctant to receive honest feedback from others, especially those closest to me?\u201d </p>  <p>Your answer will indicate the primary place to apply what you\u2019ve learned here. When you do, you\u2019ll be well on your way to wisdom. </p>  <p>SHARE THE LOVE</p>  <p>If <em>Lead to Win</em> is making a difference in your life, share the good news! The simplest way to do that is to click one of the social media buttons in the sidebar. Tag three people you want to encourage, and share the love. </p> <p>And remember to follow us on Instagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/michaelhyatt\" rel=\"noopener\">@michaelhyatt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/meghmiller\" rel=\"noopener\">@meghmiller</a>.
