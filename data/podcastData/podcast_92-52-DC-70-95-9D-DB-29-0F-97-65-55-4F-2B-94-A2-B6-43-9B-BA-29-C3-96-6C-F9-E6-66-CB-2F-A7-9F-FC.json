    "Description": "<p>\u00a0</p><h2>Part 1</h2><p>The crew chats about how Paul and Sara made the transition from individual contributors to managers overseeing teams of engineers. Sara used to see this transition as a form of selling out, but has a new perspective after having made the shift. Paul admits he still doesn\u2019t feel like a \u201cCEO\u201d and how he approaches his role as the co-founder who focuses on creating signal instead of operations. OF course, we argue about Bitcoin, and finally we examine the role luck plays in life, especially for The Rock.\u00a0</p><h2>Interview - Kent C Dodds</h2><p><a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/about/\">Kent</a> admits that when he first tried programming, he just couldn\u2019t understand strings, and decided the career path wasn\u2019t for him. He ended up on a track that would have made him an accountant or business intelligence analyst. From that perch, however, he began to find ways to automate and improve his workflows. Not only did this help him stand out at work, it reawakened his interest in coding, which is now his full time career.\u00a0</p><h2>Part 2\u00a0</h2><p>Sara talks about the difference between writing code for software applications, and writing firmware, which she got into while helping to launch and run <a href=\"https://jewelbots.com/\">Jewelbots</a>. Paul and Sara recall what it was like working in tech during the 90s, when they had to constantly worry about how to conserve RAM. We also talk about the days before <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git,</a> when folks passed a hard drive around from hand to hand. The kids today have no idea how good they have it.</p>\n",
