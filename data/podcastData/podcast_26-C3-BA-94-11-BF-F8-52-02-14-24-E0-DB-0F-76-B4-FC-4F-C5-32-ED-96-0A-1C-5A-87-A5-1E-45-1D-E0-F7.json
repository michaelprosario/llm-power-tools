    "Description": "Mona Lou Cherkaoui shared the value of having a cultural intelligence program in your company. She is certificated and licensed to facilitate Richard Lewis, Cultural Intelligence model. Our deeper conversation was asking the question \u201cWhat are we creating?\u201d We dove into the value of having a world-view in education that expands a person\u2019s knowledge to different views, conversations, and thinking.\u00a0 Is it skin color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or something else? \u00a0 From there we moved to learn more about Global Women of Impact - a new organization that helps women feel at\u00a0 home, respect who you are, and support your growth.\u00a0 Mona shared the infamous Martin Luther King essay, I have a Dream\u2026 and finished it with her own spin Where we live in a world where people are heard. \u00a0 We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Intern Whisperer Podcast is brought to you by Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
