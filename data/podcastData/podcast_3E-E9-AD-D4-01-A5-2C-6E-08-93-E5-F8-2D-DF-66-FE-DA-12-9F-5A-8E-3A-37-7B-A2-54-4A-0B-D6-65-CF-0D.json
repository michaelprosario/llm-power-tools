    "Description": "<p>Right now, plenty of people are building businesses on social media platforms, on streaming platforms, and on market platforms that they don\u2019t control. That platform can make the rules in any way they want and remove access at any time. That means founders are potentially one step away from losing their livelihood. The same goes for consumers buying from these platforms: if you lose access to your account, there goes all your purchases. As it turns out, you were licensing everything, not buying it.\u00a0</p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we talk with Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the promise that decentralized trust and distributed consensus has for software development \u2014 and for more transparency in ownership.\u00a0</p><p>Episode notes:</p><p>Cross-border payments, while they might not be the sexiest app, are <a href=\"https://ripple.com/solutions/cross-border-payments/\">one of the best product-market fits for blockchains</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more about Ripple at their <a href=\"https://ripple.com\">home page</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Check out <a href=\"https://xrpl.org/docs.html\">the documentation</a> to learn more about building on the XRP Ledger.\u00a0</p><p>Congrats to Lifeboat badge winner, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/161801/asmeurer\">asmeurer</a>, for their answer to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41860294/what-does-s-signify-in-sympy/41867990#41867990\">What does `S` signify in SymPy?</a></p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
