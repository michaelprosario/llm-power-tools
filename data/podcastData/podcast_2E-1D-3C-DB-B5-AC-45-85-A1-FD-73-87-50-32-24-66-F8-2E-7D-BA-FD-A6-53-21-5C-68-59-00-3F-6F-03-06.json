    "Description": "When you ask Kristy Tillman about design, she doesn\u2019t just talk about designing for a screen. She touches on space, rooms, fliers, products, both physical and digital. Her fluid, all-encompassing concept of design might be new to our CodeNewbie community, but it\u2019s crucial for her role as Design Director for the Society of Grownups. In this episode, we talk about her design process, how she hires for design roles, and what CodeNewbies can do when designing their own products. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
