Despite having code, there were no meaningful deliverables due to internal conflicts and fractured dynamics. Mike shares the practical techniques he employed to build trust, including individual conversations, pairing exercises, and ensemble programming to break down silos. He highlights the importance of fostering trust through collaborative activities such as team lunches, which create a foundation for improved teamwork and communication.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  What activities can you initiate to build trust and collaboration in a team?</p>   Featured Book of the Week:  Thinking, Fast and Slow  by Daniel Kahneman <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Mike recommends <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3Cr32co\"> Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman</a>  as a pivotal introduction to human behavior and decision-making.
