    "Description": "\n        <p>While many people stubbornly subscribe to the you-have-to-borrow-money-to-make-money philosophy, Dave Ramsey knows that idea is just a bold-faced lie. And he learned it the hard way. Forced to file bankruptcy in his twenties, Dave started over from scratch and has since built a multimillion-dollar business the only way he knows how: at the speed of cash. That\u2019s right, over 25 years later and now with a team of nearly 1,000 people, Dave is\u2014and has resolved to remain\u2014debt-free. Tune in to hear Dave explain why debt is never the answer, no matter how tempting an opportunity may be\u2014or how dire the circumstances (we\u2019re looking at you, COVID-19).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3hIrJ5e\">Dave Ramsey's website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3dh7vw2\"><em>EntreLeadership</em></a> by Dave Ramsey</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2N9n7XZ\">EntreLeadership's coaching programs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZDrDG6\"><em>The Infinite Game</em></a> by Simon Sinek</p><p>Ask Dave Ramsey and Daniel Tardy your question on The Dave Ramsey Show:</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:DaveOnAir%20%3CDaveOnAir@daveramsey.com%3E\"><u>Email The Dave Ramsey Show</u></a></li>\n<li>Put \"Small Business\" in the subject line</li>\n<li>Include your phone number and question in the body of the email</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2NecFhs\">6 Financial Reports That Can Save Your Company</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/37GM5Hy\">Review this episode for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>As an Amazon Associate EntreLeadership\u00a0earns from qualifying purchases.</em></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
