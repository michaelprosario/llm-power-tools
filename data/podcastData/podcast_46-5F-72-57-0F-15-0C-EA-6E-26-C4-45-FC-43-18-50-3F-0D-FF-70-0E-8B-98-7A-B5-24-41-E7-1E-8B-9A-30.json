    "Description": "<p>Eric Sheninger @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/E_Sheninger\">E_Sheninger</a> challenges us to move to the next level with digital technologies. We can't use tech because it is \"cool and new.\" It must improve learning. If it doesn't improve learning, why are we spending the money?</p> <p>In today's show, Eric challenges us to think about:</p> <ul> <li>The evidence that learning is improving</li> <li>Shifting assessment strategies that help students show what they understand</li> <li>Arguments for student (and teacher) portfolios of learning</li> <li>Why curriculum is no longer a valid argument against technology</li> <li>Encouragement for teachers who feel like an island of innovation with technology.</li> </ul> <p>We're hosting a giveaway contest at <a href= \"https://gleam.io/cbPs5/digital-leadership-by-eric-sheninger\">https://gleam.io/cbPs5/digital-leadership-by-eric-sheninger</a> of his book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2n9agqL\">Digital Leadership</a>.\u00a0</p> <p>Eric is a Senior Fellow and Thought Leader on Digital Leadership with the International Center for Leadership in Education (ICLE).
