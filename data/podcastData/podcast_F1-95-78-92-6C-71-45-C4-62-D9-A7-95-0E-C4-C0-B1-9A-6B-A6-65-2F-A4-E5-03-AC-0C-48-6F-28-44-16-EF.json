    "Description": "<p>We hope that kids will learn critical thinking skills in one class and then apply it to another. However, MIT Teaching Systems Lab Director, Dr. Justin Reich, shares that this may not be so. Today we discuss current research that is shaking up how people think about learning.</p> <p>Show Notes: <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e264\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e264</a></p> <p>This week I'll be sharing the 7 Pedagogical Shifts That Make Interactive Displays a Key to a Student-Centered Classroom on the Cool Cat Teacher blog sponsored by <a href=\"https://home.smarttech.com/\">SMART Technologies</a>. Shift #1 is that Students are collaborators. My interactive display is the common workspace for the whole class. I use it as a digital workspace, to display any screen for the whole class to see, as a large multi-touch drawing and brainstorming space and so much more. My interactive display is a must-have device. I wouldn't want to teach without one. <a href= \"http://www.inovatio.si/files/content/file/Novice/ED_1705_Filigree_need-for-IFPs_report_EN.pdf\"> Recent research</a> shows that large interactive displays are vital to the classroom ecosystem.</p>",
