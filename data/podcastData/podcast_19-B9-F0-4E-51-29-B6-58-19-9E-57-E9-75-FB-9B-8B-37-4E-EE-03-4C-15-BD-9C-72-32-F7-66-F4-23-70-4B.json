    "Description": "<p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers, technologist and author John Willis emphasized caution when considering AI solutions from vendors. He advised against blindly following vendor recommendations for \"one-size-fits-all\" AI products, likening it to discouraging learning Java in the past in favor of purchasing a product.</p><p>Willis stressed that DevOps serves as an example of how human expertise, not just products, solves problems. He urged C-level executives to first understand AI's intricacies and then make informed purchasing decisions, suggesting a \"DevOps redo\" to encourage experimentation and collaboration, similar to the early days of the DevOps movement.</p><p>Willis highlighted that early adopters of DevOps, like successful banks, heavily invested in developing their human capital. He cautioned against hasty product purchases, as the AI landscape is rife with startups that may quickly disappear or be acquired by larger companies.</p><p>Instead, Willis advocated for educating teams on effective data management techniques, including retrieval augmentation, to fine-tune large language models. He emphasized the need for data cleansing to build robust data pipelines and prevent LLMs from generating undesirable code or sensitive information.</p><p>According to Willis, the process becomes enjoyable when done correctly, especially for companies using LLMs at scale with retrieval augmentation. To ensure success, he suggested adding governance and structure, including content moderation and red-teaming of data, which vendors may not prioritize in their offerings.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about DevOps and AI:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/aiops-is-devops-ready-for-an-infusion-of-artificial-intelligence/\">AIOps: Is DevOps Ready for an Infusion of Artificial Intelligence?</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-a-devops-engineer-in-just-six-months/\">How to Build a DevOps Engineer in Just 6 Months</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/power-up-your-devops-workflow-with-ai-and-chatgpt/\">Power up Your DevOps Workflow with AI and ChatGPT</a></p>\n",
