    "Description": "<p>Deliveroo, a prominent food delivery company, relies on Apache Flink, a distributed processing engine, to enhance its three-sided marketplace, connecting delivery drivers, restaurants, and customers. Seeking to improve real-time data streaming and gain insights into customer behavior, Deliveroo transitioned to Flink, comparing it to alternatives like Apache Spark and Kafka Streams. Flink, with feature parity to their previous platform, offered stability and scalability. They initially experimented with Flink on Kubernetes but turned to the Amazon Managed Service for Flink (MSF) for enhanced support and maintenance.</p><p>Engineers from Deliveroo, Felix Angell and Duc Anh Khu, emphasized the need for flexibility in data modeling to accommodate their fast-paced product development. However, flexibility can be complex, often requiring data model adjustments. They expressed the desire for a self-serve configuration feature in MSF, allowing easy customization of low-level settings and auto-scaling based on application metrics. This move to Flink and MSF has empowered Deliveroo to focus on core responsibilities like continuous integration and delivery while efficiently managing their data processing needs.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Apache Flink and AWS:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/kinesis-kafka-and-amazon-managed-service-for-apache-flink/\" target=\"_blank\">Kinesis, Kafka and Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/apache-flink-for-real-time-data-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Flink for Real Time Data Analysis</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/apache-flink-for-unbounded-data-streams/\">Apache Flink for Unbounded Data Streams</a></p>\n",
