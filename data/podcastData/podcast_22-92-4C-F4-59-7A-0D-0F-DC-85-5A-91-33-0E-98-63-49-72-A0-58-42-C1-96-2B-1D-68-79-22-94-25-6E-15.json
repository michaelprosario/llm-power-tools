    "Description": "<p>Quentin Clark, Managing Director @ General Catalyst shares how to get your career unstuck at different scales & stages! You\u2019ll learn different frameworks you can use to benchmark your growth and identify where you might be stuck. Plus different approaches you can take to get your company and the people you lead, unstuck at scale!</p><p><i>\"The specifics of the framework are not as important as having one at all. Create some ruler... Like if you're a snail and you're trying to inch your way towards the head of lettuce, and you're trying to measure whether or not you're making progress every day... It doesn't actually matter whether or not you're using an imperial tape measure with inches or the metric system and a yardstick...</i></p><p><i>You can make up your own ruler! As long as that ruler is consistently being used over and over again. This is why I say it's important for people to have A framework... not necessarily any one framework. And that they come back to it.\u201d</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>QUENTIN CLARK, MANAGING DIRECTOR @ GENERAL CATALYST</strong></p><p>Quentin is a product and systems technical leader with broad experience in the enterprise space.
