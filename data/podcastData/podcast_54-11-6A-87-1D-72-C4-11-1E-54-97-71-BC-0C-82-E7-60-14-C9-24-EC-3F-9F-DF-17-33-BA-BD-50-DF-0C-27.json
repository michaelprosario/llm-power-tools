    "Description": "<p>How do you add custom audio, video, and text communications into your organization? Richard chats with Mary Anne Noskowski about Azure Communications Services (ACS), a set of APIs and tooling that brings the features of Teams communications into custom applications and more. Mary Anne talks about Teams integration, providing a means to customize the guest access features into Teams via ACS. The conversation also digs into a few different scenarios for optimizing customer, vendor, and employee experience in communications. It's early days for ACS, but they are taking the reins from the Skype for Business APIs - and it's the same APIs that Teams depend on, so you know they will scale!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/communication-services/\">Azure Communication Services</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/\">Azure Active Directory</a></li><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/apBX7ASurgM\">ACS on Microsoft Mechanics</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-contoso-med-app\">ACS Health Care Demo App</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-contoso-retail-app\">ACS Retail Demo App</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 5, 2021</p>\n",
