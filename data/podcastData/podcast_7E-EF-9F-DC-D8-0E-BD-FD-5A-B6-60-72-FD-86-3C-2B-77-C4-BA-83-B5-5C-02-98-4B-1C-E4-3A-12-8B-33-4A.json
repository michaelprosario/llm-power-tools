    "Description": "<p>Last week, the country of Spain dropped its mandate for residents and visitors to wear masks, to ward off further infections of the Coronavirus. So, for this year's KubeCon + CloudNativeCon \u00a0Europe conference, to be held May 16 - 20th of May in <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/15-reasons-you-should-visit-valencia-at-least-once-in-your-lifetime/\">Valencia, Spain</a>, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation dropped its own original mandate that attendees wear masks, a rule that had been in place for its other recent conferences.</p><p>This turned out to be the wrong decision, CNCF <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/04/25/clarifying-mask-mandate-update/\">admitted a week later</a>. A lot of people who already bought tickets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpetazzo/status/1518251896611516418\">were upset</a> at this laxing of the rules for the conference, which could put them in greater danger of contacting the disease.</p><p>So the CNCF put the mandate back in place, and offered refunds for those who felt Spain's own decision would put them in harm's way. CNCF will even send you a week's worth of N95 masks if you request them.</p><p>So, long story short: bring a mask to KubeCon. And, as always, it is still a requirement to show proof of vaccination and temperature checks will be made as well.</p><p>Tricky business running a conference in this time, no?</p><p>In this latest episode of <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/podcasts\">The New Stack Makers</a> podcast, we take a look at what to expect from this year's KubeCon EU 2022.\u00a0Our guests for this podcast are <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pritianka/\">Priyanka Sharma</a>, the executive director of CNCF, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-rocha-739aa718/?originalSubdomain=ch\">Ricardo Rocha</a>, who is a KubeCon co-chair and computer engineer at <a href=\"https://home.cern/\">CERN</a>. TNS Editor-in-chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joab_Jackson\">Joab Jackson</a> hosted this podcast.</p><p>We recorded this podcast prior to the discussion around masks, and at the time, Sharma said that the CNCF based the mask ruling on Spain's own country-wide mandates. \"So we are being very cautious with the health requirements for the event,\" she said.</p><p>The conference team is also keeping an eye on Russia's aggressive moves in the Ukraine, though it is unlikely that the chaos will reach all the way to Spain. Still, \"this is why it's essential to always have the hybrid option .. [to] have the virtual elements sorted,\" Sharma said.</p><p>As the CNCF flagship conference, KubeCon brings together managers and users of a wide variety of cloud native technologies, including containerd, CoreDNS, Envoy, etcd, Fluentd, Harbor, Helm, Istio, Jaeger, Kubernetes, Linkerd, Open Policy Agent, Prometheus, Rook, Vitess, Argo, CRI-O, Crossplane, dapr, Dragonfly, \u00a0Falco, Flagger, Flux, gRPC, KEDA, SPIFFE, SPIRE, and Thanos, and many many more. Most have been featured on TNS at one time or another.</p><p>In this podcast, we also discuss what to expect from the virtual sessions at the conference, what to do in Valencia, the current state of Kubernetes, and we get some unofficial picks from Sharma and Rocha as to what keynotes not miss and what sessions to attend.</p><p>\"The virtual option is great,\" Rocha said. \"But I think the in-person conferences have have their own value. And there's a lot to be to be gained about meeting people directly and exchanging ideas and going to these events on the side of the conference as well.\"</p>\n",
