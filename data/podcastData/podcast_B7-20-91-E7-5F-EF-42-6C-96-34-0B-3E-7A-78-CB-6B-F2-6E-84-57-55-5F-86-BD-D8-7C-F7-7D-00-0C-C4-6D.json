    "Description": "<p>Tyler Flint, CEO of <a href=\"http://qpoint.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">qpoint.io</a>, joins host Robert Blumen for a conversation about managing external vendor dependencies, including several best practices for adoption. They start with a look at internal versus external services, including details such as the footprint of external services within a micro-services application, and difficulties organizations have tracking their service consumption, quantifying service consumption, and auditing external services. Tyler also discusses the security implications of external services, including authentication and authorization. They examine metrics and monitoring, with recommendations on the key metrics to collect, as well as acceptable error rates for external services. From there they consider what can go wrong, how to respond to external service outages, and challenges related to testing external services. The episode wraps up with a discussion of qPoint\u2019s migration from a proxy-based solution to one based on eBPF kernel probes.</p> <p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name= \"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\" data-pm-slice= \"1 1 []\">Brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IEEE Computer Society</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.computer.org/software\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">IEEE Software magazine</a>.</p>",
