    "Description": "<p>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mlst\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/ESrGqhf5CB\n\nJoin us for a fascinating discussion of the free energy principle with Dr. Maxwell Ramsted, a leading thinker exploring the intersection of math, physics, and philosophy and Director of Research at VERSES. The FEP was proposed by renowned neuroscientist Karl Friston, this principle offers a unifying theory explaining how systems maintain order and their identity.\n\nThe free energy principle inverts traditional survival logic. Rather than asking what behaviors promote survival, it queries - given things exist, what must they do? The answer: minimizing free energy, or &quot;surprise.&quot; Systems persist by constantly ensuring their internal states match anticipated states based on a model of the world. Failure to minimize surprise leads to chaos as systems dissolve into disorder.\n\nThus, the free energy principle elucidates why lifeforms relentlessly model and predict their surroundings. It is an existential imperative counterbalancing entropy. Essentially, this principle describes the mind&#39;s pursuit of harmony between expectations and reality. Its relevance spans from cells to societies, underlying order wherever longevity is found.\n\nOur discussion explores the technical details and philosophical implications of this paradigm-shifting theory. How does it further our understanding of cognition and intelligence? What insights does it offer about the fundamental patterns and properties of existence? Can it precipitate breakthroughs in disciplines like neuroscience and artificial intelligence?\n\nDr. Ramstead completed his Ph.D. at McGill University in Montreal, Canada in 2019, with frequent research visits to UCL in London, under the supervision of the world\u2019s most cited neuroscientist, Professor Karl Friston (UCL).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>YT version: https://youtu.be/8qb28P7ksyE\n\nhttps://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ILpGOMkAAAAJ&amp;hl=frhttps://spatialwebfoundation.org/team/maxwell-ramstead/https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-ramstead-43a1991b7/https://twitter.com/mjdramstead\n\nVERSES AI: https://www.verses.ai/\n\nIntro: Tim Scarfe (Ph.D)\nInterviewer: Keith Duggar (Ph.D MIT)\n\nTOC:\n0:00:00 - Tim Intro\n0:08:10 - Intro and philosophy\n0:14:26 - Intro to Maxwell\n0:18:00 - FEP\n0:29:08 - Markov Blankets\n0:51:15 - Verses AI / Applications of FEP\n1:05:55 - Potential issues with deploying FEP\n1:10:50 - Shared knowledge graphs\n1:14:29 - XRisk / Ethics\n1:24:57 - Strength of Verses\n1:28:30 - Misconceptions about FEP, Physics vs philosophy/criticism\n1:44:41 - Emergence / consciousness\n\nReferences:\nPrincipia Mathematica\nhttps://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30567249049\n\nAndy Clark&#39;s paper &quot;Whatever Next?
