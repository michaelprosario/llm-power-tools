    "Description": "<p>Two decades ago, security was an afterthought; it was often \u2018bolted on\u2019 to existing applications that left businesses with a reactive approach to threat visibility and enforcement. But with the proliferation of cloud native applications and businesses employing a work from anywhere model, the traditional approach to security is being reimagined to play an integral role from development through operations. From identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and adapting to risk across the applications, organizations are moving to a full view of their risk posture by employing security across the entire lifecycle.</p><p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ratantipirneni/\">Ratan Tipirneni, President and & CEO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tigera.io/\">Tigera</a> discusses how organizations can take an active approach to security by bringing zero-trust principles to reduce the application\u2019s attack surface, harness machine learning to combat runtime security risks and enable a continuous compliance while mitigating risks from vulnerabilities and attacks through security policy changes.</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a>, founder and publisher of The New Stack hosted this podcast.</p>\n",
