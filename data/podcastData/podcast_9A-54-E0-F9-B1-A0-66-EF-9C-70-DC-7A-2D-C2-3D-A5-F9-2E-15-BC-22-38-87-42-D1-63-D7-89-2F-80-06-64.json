    "Description": "<p>As a newly arrived immigrant from Turkey, Hamdi Ulukaya learned to be resourceful, determined, and even stubborn when he needed<strong> </strong>to be. All those traits would&nbsp;serve him well as he began to navigate the hairpin turns of building a yogurt business from the ground up.&nbsp;In 2005, Hamdi was running a small feta cheese business in upstate New York when he happened upon a piece of junk mail that would change his life: an ad for an abandoned yogurt factory...$700K, as is.&nbsp;He knew if he could get his hands on it, he could bring a new kind of dairy product to the U.S.\u2014the thick, creamy yogurt he\u2019d grown up eating in the mountains of Turkey.&nbsp;With the help of a local bank, Hamdi bought the factory, and sales grew so quickly that he could barely keep up.&nbsp;A few years later, some bad business decisions nearly pushed the company into bankruptcy, but today, Chobani is one of the most popular yogurt brands in the U.S; and Greek-style<strong> </strong>yogurt has become a staple of the dairy aisle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
