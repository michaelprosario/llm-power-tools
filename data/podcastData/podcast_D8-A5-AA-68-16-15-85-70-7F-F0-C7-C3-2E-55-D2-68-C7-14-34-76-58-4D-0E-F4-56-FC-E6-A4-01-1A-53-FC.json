So you could stay on your couch, but have an agent visit a home, but we could only get a very small number of people to hit that button. Despite all of our trying, we only had 1% of our tours happening virtually and then the pandemic hit and almost overnight, it jumped to about a third of our tours being virtual.\"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Bridget Frey \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Our in-person conference <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">ELC Annual</a> returns 10/27-28!</strong></h2><p>Learn from 60+ of the best engineering leaders in the industry / Critical insights on leadership, career and technology / Plus tons of experiences optimized for deep conversations & meaningful connections - all to help you build your support network!</p><p><strong><i>Don't miss out on being part of the biggest celebration of engineering leadership of the year!</i></strong></p><h3>Grab your ticket HERE: <strong><a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">sfelc.com/annual2022</a></strong></h3><hr /><h2><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong> <a href=\"http://jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a></h2><p>For insights into where engineering teams are investing their time and resources, how they\u2019re operating and performing, and the way in which leaders are managing today\u2026</p><h3>Download <strong>\u201cThe State of Engineering Management Report 2022\u201d HERE:</strong></h3><h3><a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/emr/\">jellyfish.co/emr</a></h3><p>To understand how your engineering org compares against teams from across the industry and gain data-driven metrics to inform your strategic decisions regarding the right tools, processes and workflows\u2026</p><h3>Learn More About <strong>Jellyfish Benchmarks @</strong> <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/benchmarks/\"><strong>jellyfish.co/benchmarks</strong></a></h3><h2>Check out our friends at <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\">Shortcut</a>!</h2><p><a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>Shortcut</strong></a> is an issue tracker that offers all the functionality, without most of the complexity making it easier for you to plan, collaborate, build, and measure success.</p><p><i><strong>Right now, listeners of our show can get 2-months free on any paid plan.</strong></i></p><h3><strong>Learn more & sign up at</strong> <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>shortcut.com/elc</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>How Bridget lead a real estate tech org through a pandemic & tumultuous housing market (1:05)</li><li>COVID-19\u2019s impact on the healthcare tech space (2:02)</li><li>How to adapt product strategy based on customer patterns (5:02)</li><li>Leading with transparency & decisiveness in uncertain times (7:20)</li><li>Redfin\u2019s transition to digitizing traditionally in-person experiences (10:58)</li><li>The pandemic\u2019s unexpected influence on employee mental health & burnout (16:14)</li><li>How your org can implement a company-wide \u201cno meeting\u201d / wellness week (19:43)</li><li>Set your org up for faster decision making & implementation (23:52)</li><li>Challenges & solutions when building out AI/ML home buying products (25:06)</li><li>Incorporating human needs, desires & perspectives in automated recommendation products (27:40)</li><li>Engineering best practices for uncovering deeper customer needs (30:06)</li><li>The inside scoop on modeling an \u201cuncertainty\u201d algorithm (31:12)</li><li>Prioritization conversations & product strategy at Redfin (34:31)</li><li>Addressing data bias & systemic racism within product features (36:33)</li><li>How hiring diversely leads to reduced data bias (39:06)</li><li>A framework for reducing biased data outputs (40:20)</li><li>What hiring practices lead to a more diverse team (43:43)</li><li>How tech orgs can cultivate a culture of inclusivity & diversity (46:08)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (48:51)</li></ul>\n",
