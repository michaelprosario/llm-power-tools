    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a> is not just a cache. It is used in the broader cloud native ecosystem, fits into many service-oriented architectures, and simplifies the deployment and development of modern applications, according to <a href=\"https://github.com/madolson\">Madelyn Olson</a>, a principal engineer at AWS, during an interview on the <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-aws-open-source-strategy/\">New Stack Makers</a> at <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/\">KubeCon North America in Detroit</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Olson said that people have a primary backend database or some other workflow that takes a long time to run. They store the intermediate results in Redis, which provides lower latency and higher throughput.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"But there are plenty of other ways you can use Redis,\" Olson said. \"One common way is what I like to call it a data projection API. So you basically take a bunch of different sources of data, maybe a Postgres database, or some other type of Cassandra database, and you project that data into Redis. And then you just pull from the Redis instance. This is a really great, great use case for low latency applications.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Redis creator <a href=\"http://invece.org/\">Salvatore Sanfilippo's</a> approach provides a lesson in how to contribute to open source, which Olson recounted in our interview.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Olson said he was the only maintainer with write permissions for the project. That meant contributors would have to engage quite a bit to get a response from Sanfilippo. So Olson did what open source contributors do when they want to get noticed. She \"chopped wood and carried water,\" a term that in open source reflects on working to take care of tasks that need attention. That helped Sanfilippo scale himself a bit and helped Olson get involved in the project.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It is daunting to get into open source development work, Olson said. A new contributor will face people with a lot more experience and get afraid to open issues. But if a contributor has a use case and helps with documentation or a bug, then most open source maintainers are willing to help.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"One big problem throughout open source is, they're usually resource constrained, right?,\" Olson said. \"Open source is oftentimes a lot of volunteers. So they're usually very willing to get more people to help with the project.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>What's it like now working at AWS on open source projects?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Things have changed a lot since Olson joined AWS in 2015, Olson said. APIs were proprietary back in those days. Today, it's almost the opposite of how it used to be.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>To keep something internal now requires approval, Olson said. Internal differentiation is not needed. For example, open source Redis is most important, with AWS on top as the managed service.</p>\n",
