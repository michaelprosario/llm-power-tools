    "Description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Simon Bennetts, a distinguished engineer at Jit, discusses one of the flagship projects of OWASP: the Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) open source security testing tool. As ZAP\u2019s primary maintainer, Simon traces the tool's origins and shares some anecdotes with SE Radio host <a href= \"https://www.se-radio.net/team/priyanka-raghavan/\">Priyanka Raghavan</a> on why there was a need for it. They take a deep dive into ZAP\u2019s features and its ability to integrate with CI/CD, as well as shift security left. Bennetts also considers what it takes to build a successful open source project before spending time on ZAP\u2019s ability to script to provide richer results. Finally, the conversation ends with some questions on ZAP\u2019s future in this AI-powered world of bots.</p>",
