    "Description": "<p>This week freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Phoebe Voong-Fadel about her childhood as the daughter of refugees,  and how she self-studied coding and became a professional developer at the age of 36.</p> <p>Phoebe worked from age 12 at her parent's Chinese take-out restaurant. She was able to study history at the London School of Economics, before working in higher ed.</p> <p>She left her job to raise two kids due to the high cost of childcare in the UK, and spent years self-studying coding before becoming a software developer at age 36.</p> <p> I recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails. As with all my podcast episodes, I start by performing a classic bass line. Can you guess what song this bass line is from? It's from 1989.</p> <p>Phoebe has earned multiple certifications from freeCodeCamp, and also published a number of articles on our publication.</p> <p>How Phoebe went from stay-at-home mom to Front End Web Developer at age 36: <a href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-went-from-stay-at-home-mum-to-front-end-web-developer-39724046692a/\"> https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-went-from-stay-at-home-mum-to-front-end-web-developer-39724046692a/</a></p> <p>Phoebe's review of Harvard CS50: <a href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cs50-course-review/\">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cs50-course-review/</a></p> <p>The BBC Take-away Kids documentary, which Phoebe said is what her childhood was like, working from age 12: <a href= \"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-47007812\">https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-47007812</a></p> <p>Phoebe's website, with her portfolio and links to her socials: https://www.thecodinghamster.com/</p> <p> You can watch a video version of my interview with Phoebe here:\u00a0<a href= \"https://youtu.be/WomQr-jRO1c\">https://youtu.be/WomQr-jRO1c</a></p> <p>If you've read this far, consider supporting our 501(c)(3) public charity, and aiding us in our mission to create more free learning resources for everyone: <a href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\">https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
