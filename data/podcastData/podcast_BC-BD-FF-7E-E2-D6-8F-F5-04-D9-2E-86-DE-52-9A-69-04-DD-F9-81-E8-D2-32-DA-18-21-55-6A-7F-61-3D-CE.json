    "SourceUrl": "http://go.ted.com/lianafinck",
    "Description": "<p>Cartoonist Liana Finck's drawings hold our hands through life's predicaments, big and small: dating, breakups, what to make for dinner, how to leave a party without being rude, how to think about our relationship with God. In a funny, moving talk, she shares some of her drawings and shows how she uses creativity to navigate false starts and cluelessness in the search for belonging.</p><br><p>This episode originally aired January 2, 2024.</p><p>For a chance to give your own TED Talk, fill out the Idea Search Application:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ted.com/ideasearch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ted.com/ideasearch</a>.</p><br><p>Interested in learning more about upcoming TED events?
