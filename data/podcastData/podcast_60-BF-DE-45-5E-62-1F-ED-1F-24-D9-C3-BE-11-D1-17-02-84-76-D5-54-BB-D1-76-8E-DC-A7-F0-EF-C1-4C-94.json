    "Description": "<p class=\"p1\">Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math comprise STEAM learning. However, there is more to a true STEM mindset than just the content. Today Tim Needles talks about five elements that comprise an effective STEAM mindset to help us bring these topics into our classrooms as we teach and learn together.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://coolcatteacher.com/e665\">coolcatteacher.com/e665</a>\u00a0</p> <p class=\"p1\">Sponsor: In today\u2019s challenging times, we know how critical it is to make sure kids are equipped with social and emotional learning skills to cope with the world around them. That's why I\u2019m excited to highlight the <a href= \"https://www.we.org/en-US/our-work/we-schools/sel/\">WE Schools Program</a>, made possible by The Allstate Foundation. It brings social and emotional learning together with service-learning, helping children build key skills such as resilience, empathy, perseverance and problem-solving. Whether you're an educator looking for ways to integrate SEL into your lesson planning, or a parent looking to support your kid's remote learning at home, go to <a href= \"http://we.org/SEL\">WE.org/SEL</a> for helpful educational resources and tips.
