    "Description": "<p>When you think about self-driving cars, you might imagine relaxing in the back seat while a vehicle carries you to your destination. But according to Dave Ferguson, nearly half of all car tips that Americans take don\u2019t actually need any passengers at all. That\u2019s because we spend a lot of our time driving around just to pick things up, like groceries and takeout.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Dave talks with Guy about his vision of a future where many of these everyday errands could be done by robots. Dave\u2019s company, Nuro, builds autonomous vehicles that are meant to deliver goods rather than carry passengers. Already they\u2019ve run pilot deliveries with big-name partners like Domino\u2019s Pizza, Uber Eats, and Kroger Grocery stores, and in the next few years, they aim to expand their service to cities all across the country.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
