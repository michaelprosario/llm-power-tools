    "Description": "<p>Valkey, a Redis fork supported by the Linux Foundation, challenges Redis' new license. In this episode, Madelyn Olson, a lead contributor to the Valkey project and former Redis core contributor, along with Ping Xie, Staff Software Engineer at Google and Dmitry Polyakovsky, Consulting Member of Technical Staff at Oracle highlights concerns about the shift to a more restrictive license at Open Source Summit 2024 in Seattle.\u00a0</p><p>Despite Redis' free license for end users, many contributors may not support it. Valkey, with significant industry backing, prioritizes continuity and a smooth transition for Redis users. AWS, along with Google and Oracle maintainers, emphasizes the importance of open, permissive licenses for large tech companies. Valkey plans incremental updates and module development in Rust to enhance functionality and attract more engineers. The focus remains on compatibility, continuity, and consolidating client behaviors for a robust ecosystem.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the Valkey Project and changes to Open Source licensing</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/linux-foundation-forks-the-open-source-redis-as-valkey/\">Linux Foundation Backs 'Valkey' Open Source Fork of Redis\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/redis-pulls-back-on-open-source-licensing-citing-stingy-cloud-services/\">Redis Pulls Back on Open Source Licensing, Citing Stingy Cloud Services</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/hashicorp-abandons-open-source-for-business-source-license/\">HashiCorp's Licensing Change is only the Latest Challenge to Open Source\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
