    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with the Senior Underwriter Dominic Roe about his actuarial work and the pioneering and implementation of a risk assessment method he\u2019s utilized for insurance companies that\u2019s now widespread across Australia. You will hear a very detailed explanation of how he built his model. You will also learn about geodemographic segmentation and hear some very interesting use cases of geodemographic segmentation in data science.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/243\">www.superdatascience.com/243</a></p>\n      ",
