    "Description": "<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"23\">In this episode,\u00a0Charles Humble\u00a0speaks withhost <a href=\"https://www.se-radio.net/team/brijesh-ammanath/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brijesh Ammanath</a>\u00a0about skills that can provide developers a grounding in <em>systems thinking</em>.</p> <p data-renderer-start-pos=\"23\">Charles is a 30-year veteran of the IT industry, including as a former software engineer, architect, and CTO, as well as former editor in chief of InfoQ and chief editor for Container Solutions.\u00a0He has published \u201cProfessional Skills for Software Engineers\u201d as a series of 14 O\u2019Reilly shortcuts covering communication, critical thinking, documentation, and networking.</p> <p data-renderer-start-pos=\"23\">Underlying his work is the idea that as complexity increases in IT systems, the roles of architects and leaders move from linear thinking to something that might be more broadly defined as systems thinking -- looking at problems and systems as a whole rather than just the individual parts. This requires a skill set that isn\u2019t generally taught or widely valued as an industry -- in part, because it's hard to test in whiteboard interviews. It requires a mixture of communication skills; interpersonal skills; critical thinking; the ability to synthesize large amounts of information.\u00a0</p> <p>Brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.computer.org\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IEEE Computer Society</a> and <a href= \"https://www.computer.org/software\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">IEEE Software magazine</a>.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
