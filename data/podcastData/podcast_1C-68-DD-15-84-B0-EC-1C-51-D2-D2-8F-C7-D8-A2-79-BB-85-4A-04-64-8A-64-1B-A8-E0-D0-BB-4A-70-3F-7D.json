    "Description": "<p>Is ransomware getting worse? Richard talks to Microsoft VP of Cybersecurity Ann Johnson about the state ransomware today. Ann quotes Sutton's law: \"Why do criminals rob banks? Because that's where the money is.\" An increasing number of cybercriminals have successfully extorted money from companies using ransomware. So yes, ransomware is becoming more popular amongst criminals and will continue to do so until it doesn't pay. Ann explains that the Zero Trust Security Model is essential - as are data backups that you know how to restore! Beyond our efforts at the IT level, Ann talks about ongoing relationships with organizations like the FBI to go after cybercriminals at a higher level, shutting down infrastructure and charging the criminals with crimes. Ransomware is getting worse, and it's up to us to fight back!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://runasradio.com/Shows/Show/696\">Cybersecurity During the Pandemic</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.riskiq.com/\">RiskIQ</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.podcastone.com/Afternoon-Cyber-Tea-with-Microsofts-Ann-Johnson\">Afternoon Cyber Tea with Microsoft's Ann Johnson</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 23, 2021</p>\n",
