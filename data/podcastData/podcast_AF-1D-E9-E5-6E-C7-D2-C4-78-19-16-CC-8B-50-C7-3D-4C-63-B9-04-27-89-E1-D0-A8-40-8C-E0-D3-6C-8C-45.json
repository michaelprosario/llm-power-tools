    "Description": "<p>We&rsquo;re taking our own advice and hitting pause to recharge this July. While we&rsquo;re off the mic, revisit past episodes packed with timeless insights and conversations you may have missed. </p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>This week, we&#39;re pressing pause to model the sustainable pace we teach. Brian shares a quick update about our summer break, what&rsquo;s ahead in August, and how you can make the most of the podcast archive while we&rsquo;re away.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re poolside or simply stepping back from the daily sprint, we hope you&rsquo;ll join us in creating a little breathing room and we can&rsquo;t wait to be back with a fresh season soon.</p>\n\n<h2>References and resources mentioned in the show:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast\">Subscribe &amp; Listen to Previous Episodes of&nbsp;the <em>Agile Mentors Podcast</em></a></p>\n\n<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>\n\n<p>This show is designed for you, and we&rsquo;d love your input.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enjoyed what you heard today?

So for us that means we&#39;re gonna take a few weeks off. It&#39;s summer and I know many of you are going to be taking time off with your families and we&#39;re gonna be doing the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>So we won&#39;t be around for the next month. We&#39;re gonna be out of here for July, but already have some plans for when we come back in August. So stay tuned when we come back in August, we&#39;ve got a new season of shows that will begin there in August that I think you&#39;ll really enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>While we&#39;re off, might I suggest you go back through our archive. Look at some of the previous podcast episodes we&#39;ve done. There&#39;s quite a few now. And maybe you&#39;ve missed some of the episodes from the past. Go back and find some of our great guests that we&#39;ve had over the years when we&#39;ve been doing this. I think you&#39;ll find some really great guests and some really interesting topics. So fill your diet of Agile Mentors with that while we&#39;re at taking a little bit of a break here at Agile Mentors.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you&#39;re having a great summer and we look forward to seeing all of you back here in August. Take care.</p>",
