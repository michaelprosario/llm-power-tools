    "Description": "<p>Charles Petzold wrote the book on Windows. Specifically, he wrote &quot;Programming Windows, 1st edition&quot; in 1988. This was the book I learned on and I still have it on my shelf. Charles has never stopped writing and is now working on a free book for Microsoft Press called &quot;Programming Windows Phone 7 Series.&quot; I get the scoop from Chuck in this interview recorded in the waning hours of Mix 10 in Las Vegas.</p>\n",
