    "Description": "<p>Today I'm joined by Shawn Wang, AKA Swyx. I first interviewed Shawn in 2019. Back then, Shawn had quit his $350k a year finance job and taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp. He was working as a full stack engineer. It's a wild interview that you should go back and listen to... after of course you finish listening this.</p> <p>Now a lot of people thought Shawn was crazy leaving finance. But this dude knew what he was doing. He has now risen through the ranks as a developer at tech startups. And now he's starting an AI startup of his own. He's already off to a strong start, having raised a $3 million pre-seed round from investors.</p> <p>This is the first time I've ever invited a guest return to the freeCodeCamp podcast for a second interview. And there was so much to talk about, I feel like I could have interviewed Shawn for days.</p> <p>The man has been eating, sleeping, and breathing AI engineering for the past year. I learned so much from talking with him. I'm confident that you will, too.</p> <p>Watch Swyx's AI Engineering conference live stream: <a href= \"https://ai.engineer\">https://ai.engineer</a></p> <p>The Latent Space Podcast: <a href= \"https://www.latent.space/podcast\">https://www.latent.space/podcast</a></p> <p> Follow Swyx on Twitter:\u00a0<a style= \"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"https://twitter.com/swyx\">https://twitter.com/swyx</a></p>",
