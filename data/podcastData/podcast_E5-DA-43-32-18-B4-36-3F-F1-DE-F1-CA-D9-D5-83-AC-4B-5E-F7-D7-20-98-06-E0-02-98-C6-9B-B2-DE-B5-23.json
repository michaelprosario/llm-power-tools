    "Description": "<p>Large Language Models like ChatGPT are all the rage, but how will they impact work going forward? Richard chats with Paul Thurrott about the role of LLMs in the Windows ecosystem. Paul digs into the history of ChatGPT and how this whole wave of technology started more or less by accident until Microsoft grabbed on and created BingAI. Now with announcements for Copilot for security and M365, where else can the technology go? The conversation digs into the power of having a tool that can help you make sense of all the products you own and to go down the checklist of the right things to do when taking on a new task. We're still in the early days for large language models - the next version of Windows should be interesting!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot\">Microsoft Security Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva\">Microsoft Viva</a></li><li><a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/web-browsers/microsoft-edge/280675/tip-remove-the-bing-button-from-microsoft-edge-111\">Removing the Bing Button from Microsoft Edge 111</a></li></ul><p>Recorded April 3, 2023</p>\n",
