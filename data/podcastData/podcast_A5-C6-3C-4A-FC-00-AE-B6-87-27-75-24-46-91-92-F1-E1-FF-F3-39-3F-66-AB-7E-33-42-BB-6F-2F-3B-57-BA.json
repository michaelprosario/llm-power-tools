    "Description": "<p>The tech industry faces a paradox: despite high demand for skills, many developers and engineers are unemployed. At KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Salt Lake City, Utah, Andela and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced an initiative to train 20,000 technologists in cloud native computing over the next decade. oss O'neill, Senior Program Manager at Andela and Chris Aniszczyk, CNCF\u2019s CTO, highlighted the lack of Kubernetes-certified professionals in regions like Africa and emphasized the need for global inclusivity to make cloud native technology ubiquitous.</p><p>Andela, operating in over 135 countries and founded in Nigeria, views this program as a continuation of its mission to upskill African talent, aligning with its partnerships with tech giants like Google, AWS, and Nvidia. This initiative also addresses the increasing employer demand for Kubernetes and modern cloud skills, reflecting a broader skills mismatch in the tech workforce.</p><p>Aniszczyk noted that companies urgently seek expertise in cloud native infrastructure, observability, and platform engineering. The partnership aims to bridge these gaps, offering opportunities to meet evolving global tech needs.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about developer talent, skills and needs:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/recruiters-speak-top-skills-devs-need-for-ai-cloud-jobs/\">Top Developer Skills for AI and Cloud Jobs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/5-software-development-skills-ai-will-render-obsolete/\">5 Software Development Skills AI Will Render Obsolete</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native-skill-gaps-are-killing-your-gains/\">Cloud Native Skill Gaps are Killing Your Gains</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
