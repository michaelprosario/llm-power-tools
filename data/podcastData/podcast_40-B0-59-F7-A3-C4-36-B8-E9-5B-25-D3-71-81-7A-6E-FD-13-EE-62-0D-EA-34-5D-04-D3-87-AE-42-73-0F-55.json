    "Description": "<p>In this New Stack Makers podcast, Martin Parker, a solutions architect for UST, spoke with TNS editor-in-chief, Heather Joslyn and discussed the significance of internal developer platforms (IDPs), emphasizing benefits beyond frontend developers to backend engineers and site reliability engineers (SREs).\u00a0</p><p>Parker highlighted the role of IDPs in automating repetitive tasks, allowing SREs to focus on optimizing application performance. Standardization is key, ensuring observability and monitoring solutions align with best practices and cater to SRE needs. By providing standardized service level indicators (SLIs) and key performance indicators (KPIs), IDPs enable SREs to maintain reliability efficiently. Parker stresses the importance of avoiding siloed solutions by establishing standardized practices and tools for effective monitoring and incident response. Overall, the deployment of IDPs aims to streamline operations, reduce incidents, and enhance organizational value by empowering SREs to concentrate on system maintenance and improvements.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about UST:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloud-cost-unit-economics-a-modern-profitability-model/\">Cloud Cost-Unit Economics- A Modern Profitability Model\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native-users-struggle-to-achieve-benefits-report-says/ \">Cloud Native Users Struggle to Achieve Benefits, Report Says</a>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/ \">John our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
