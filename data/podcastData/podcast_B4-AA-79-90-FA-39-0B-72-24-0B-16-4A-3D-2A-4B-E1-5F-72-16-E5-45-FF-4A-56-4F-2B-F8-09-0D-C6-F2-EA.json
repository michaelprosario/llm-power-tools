    "Description": "<p>When Robinhood went down at the beginning of March, many speculated it might have been caused by the extra \u00a0day, February 29th. This is a leap year after all. Robinhood blamed the outage on an unprecedented spike in usage. Either way, it go us thinking about time.\u00a0</p><p>For example, Postgres has a great understanding of time as a database. Like, it really knows all the different things that happened going back to literally year 4,000 BC including years that were skipped when they re-crafted the calendar and just like bananas stuff that happens with calendars over time. An excellent source of truth if it fits with your project.</p><p>Next, a user shared the story of a wild interaction between Docker and the driver used by Razor peripherals. You can't have your fancy gaming mouse fired up and also be working on some container orchestration. Apparently they <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/815l9n/docker_for_windows_wont_start_if_razer_synapse_3/\">request the same GUID</a> and get a bit confused if one already exists.\u00a0</p><p>If you're still feeling a little uncertain about exactly how Docker/Kubernetes works, Paul suggests this <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/the-childrens-illustrated-guide-to-kubernetes/\">lovely illustrated guide</a> for children or <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/kubernetes-comic\">this comic</a>, which is for grown ups.</p><p>We chat about MySpace and whether it was ever cutting edge during its rise to prominence?\u00a0</p><p>Last, we dive into the pronunciation of \"char\", by the end of which, half of us have turned into full blown pirate impersonators.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
