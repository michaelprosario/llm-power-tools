    "Description": "\n        In the early 2000s, Perry Chen was trying to put on a concert in New Orleans when he thought, what if fans could fund this in advance? His idea didn't work at the time, but he and his co-founders spent the next eight years refining the concept of crowdfunding creative projects. Today Kickstarter has funded over 155,000 projects worldwide. PLUS for our postscript \"How You Built That,\" we check back in with Dustin Hogard who co-designed a survival belt that's full of tiny gadgets and thin enough to wear every day.
