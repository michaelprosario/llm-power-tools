    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Head of Data Science at Scribd, Kevin Perko. You will learn what it's like to be a data science manager, or a data science leader, and what it's like to manage a team, and more so two teams, in two different locations, and how that is different to actually doing the technical work. Also, you'll learn about the Book Genome Project at Scribd, what it's like when a company sees data science as a product, as opposed to an auxiliary function, and a very valuable concept of decentralized, or embedded teams, versus core data science teams and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/279\">www.superdatascience.com/279</a></p>\n      ",
