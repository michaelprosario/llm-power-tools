    "Description": "Juan loves his home country, Colombia. But he was frustrated by the pervasive negative headlines describing the country as dangerous. He knew Colombia\u2019s potential, and he wanted to show the world what it was capable of. So he started organizing tech conferences. We talk about how conferences have helped grow and strengthen the Latin America tech community, and how Juan manages to do this work from his home in New York.
