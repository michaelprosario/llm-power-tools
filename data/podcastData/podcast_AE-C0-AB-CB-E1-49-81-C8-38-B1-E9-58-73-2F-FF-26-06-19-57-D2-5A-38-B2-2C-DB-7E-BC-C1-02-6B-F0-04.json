    "Description": "<p>2021 was a tough year for security - how can we do better in 2022? Richard chats with Jess Dodson about working to get better at information security in your organization. Jess talks about the log4j exploit as a great example of \"what don't we know\" - and the need for a software bill of materials as part of your configuration management database. Having a list of the libraries that internal applications depend on helps you respond in a time of crisis, being able to answer the question \"where are we vulnerable?\" This leads to a conversation about better DevSecOps - where development, security, and operations all take security seriously and help each other to help the organization succeed!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://powerapps.microsoft.com/\">Power Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/microsoft-sentinel/\">Azure Sentinel</a></li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials\">Software Bill of Materials</a></li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management_database\">Configuration Management Database</a></li></ul><p>Recorded December 20, 2021</p>\n",
