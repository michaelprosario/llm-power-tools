    "Description": "<p>Developers just want to know if they have a vulnerability before putting code into production. But often, the answer back is not what the developer wants to hear.</p><p>More analysis is needed, the software security group will often reply, said Meera Rao, senior director of product management at Synopsys, in this latest episode of The New Stack Makers, hosted by Alex Williams, founder and publisher of The New Stack,</p><p>Rao is the creator of a new intelligent orchestration technology that helps developers get their issues resolved without a long wait. That long wait is remedied by relying on Synopsys\u2019 system to let developers know what\u2019s wrong and whether specific security holes require immediate fixing or not.</p>\n",
