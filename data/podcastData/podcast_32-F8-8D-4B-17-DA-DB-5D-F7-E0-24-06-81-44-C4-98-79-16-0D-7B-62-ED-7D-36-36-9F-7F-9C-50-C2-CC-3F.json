However, for her, the joy of seeing students engaged in mastering writing skills has been the catalyst for pursuing her dream. This love of empowering students with the awareness of their capabilities led her to return to Booker T. Washington (BTW) Magnet where she once benefited from an arts education through the Carver Creative and Performing Arts Program (CCPAC), which is now BTW. In her role as an educator at BTW, she contributes to cross-curricular planning initiatives, which encourage art and academic teachers to collaborate on special projects and classroom instruction.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>When her school partnered with\u00a0 the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) and A+ College Ready,\u00a0 she started teaching Advanced Placement (AP) Language and Composition in 2009 and was recognized by NMSI as the AP English Teacher of the Year for increasing the AP Language exam scores for minority students.</p> <p>In 2017, she pursued a certification in Instructional Leadership so that she could continue to mentor new teachers. Her greatest joy has been to see her former students become teachers in Montgomery, in Alabama, and in the nation</p> <p>Twitter: @<a href= \"https://www.twitter.com/ZestlanSimmons\">ZestlanSimmons</a></p> <p>Instagram: @<a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/zsimmons99\">zsimmons99</a></p>  Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
