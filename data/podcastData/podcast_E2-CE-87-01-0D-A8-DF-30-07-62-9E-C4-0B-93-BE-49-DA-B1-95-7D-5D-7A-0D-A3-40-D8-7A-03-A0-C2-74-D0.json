    "Description": "<p>The pandemic has put a lot of stress on teams - how do we make them stronger? Richard talks to Stephanie Donahue about strengthening teams and communities as we emerge from the pandemic. Steph talks about the water cooler and happy hour conversations lost the past couple of years and the value they once provided and should again. Does that mean going back to the office? What are the alternatives? Maybe the new tools can help, or we should just have lunch?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think\">Weak Ties BBC Article</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation\">Chris Voss Negotiation Training</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/insights\">Viva Insights</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/blog/meta-quest-pro-price-release-date/\">Meta Quest Pro</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/engage\">Viva Engage</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 25, 2022</p>\n",
