    "Description": "\n        <p>If you ask <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author <a href=\"https://charlesduhigg.com/books/\">Charles Duhigg</a>, many of the most innovative ideas today aren\u2019t exactly original\u2014and he\u2019s got plenty of evidence to prove it. Instead, the most creative, ground-breaking solutions are often the result of bringing old solutions to new problems. And ignoring conventional wisdom, he says, is a huge part of that process. Join us as Charles breaks down the highly effective habits of creative people so you can learn how to drive innovation in your own organization.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/critical-thinking\">Critical Thinking Cheat Sheet</a> from EntreLeadership</p> <p><a href=\"https://freetrial.infusionsoft.com/signup\">14-Day Free Trial</a> from Infusionsoft</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
