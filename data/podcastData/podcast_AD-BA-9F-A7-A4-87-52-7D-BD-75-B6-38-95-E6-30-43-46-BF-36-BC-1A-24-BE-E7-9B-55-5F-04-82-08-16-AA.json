    "Description": "<p>In this on-the-road episode of The New Stack Makers, Editor in Chief Heather Joslyn speaks with Ev Kontsevoy, CEO and co-founder of Teleport, from the floor of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in London. The discussion centers on infrastructure security and the growing need for robust identity management. Citing alarming cybersecurity statistics\u2014such as the $5 million average cost of a breach and rising attack frequency\u2014Kontsevoy stresses that complexity is the root challenge in securing infrastructure.\u00a0</p><p>Today\u2019s environments involve countless layers and technologies, each with its own identity and access controls, increasing the risk of human error and breaches. Kontsevoy argues for treating all entities\u2014humans, laptops, servers, AI agents\u2014as identities managed under a unified framework. Teleport provides a zero trust access platform that enforces strong, cryptographically-backed identity across systems.\u00a0</p><p>He also highlights Teleport\u2019s version 17 release, which boosts support for non-human identities and integrates deeply with AWS. Looking ahead, Teleport is exploring support for emerging AI agent protocols like MCP to extend its identity-first approach.\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights about Teleport:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/removing-the-complexity-to-securely-access-the-infrastructure/ \">Removing the Complexity to Securely Access the Infrastructure\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/why-ai-cant-protect-you-from-ai-generated-attacks/ \">Why AI Can\u2019t Protect You from AI-Generated Attacks\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
