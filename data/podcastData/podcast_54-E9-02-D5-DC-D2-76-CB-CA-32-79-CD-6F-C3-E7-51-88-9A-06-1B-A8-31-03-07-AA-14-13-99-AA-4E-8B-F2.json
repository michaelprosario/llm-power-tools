    "Description": "\n        <p>With no formal training in business or computer design, Nelson Gonzalez and his cofounders decided to do what almost no other company was doing in the mid-1990\u2019s: make personal computers specifically for gaming. They started as a tiny custom shop in Miami, and eventually began building PC\u2019s for avid gamers, who were willing to pay top dollar for higher speed, better graphics, and a brightly-colored chassis that looked like the head of an Alien.
