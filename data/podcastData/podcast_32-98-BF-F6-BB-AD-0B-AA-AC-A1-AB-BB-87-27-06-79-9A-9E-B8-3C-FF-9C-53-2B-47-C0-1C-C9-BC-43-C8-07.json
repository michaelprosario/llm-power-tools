    "Description": "<p>For years ScummVM has allowed us all to play classic point-and-click adventure games by providing a runtime for the original data files. Most recently the classic \"Blade Runner\" was rescued after a herculean effort by the ScummVM team and is now available for purchase on GOG.com. Scott talks to Eugene Sandulenko about why ScummVM is NOT an emulator, how it works, and why it's so important.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://gog.com/game/blade_runner?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d\">Download Blade Runner (1997) from GOG</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.scummvm.org/\">https://www.scummvm.org/</a></li></ul>\n",
