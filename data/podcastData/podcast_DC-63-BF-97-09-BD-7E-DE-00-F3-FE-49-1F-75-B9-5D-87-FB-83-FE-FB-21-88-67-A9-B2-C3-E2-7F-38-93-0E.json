    "Description": "<p>Generative Deep Learning, 2nd Edition [David Foster]</p>\n<p>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Support us! https://www.patreon.com/mlst </p>\n<p>MLST Discord: https://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/MLStreetTalk</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In this conversation, Tim Scarfe and David Foster, the author of &#39;Generative Deep Learning,&#39; dive deep into the world of generative AI, discussing topics ranging from model families and auto regressive models to the democratization of AI technology and its potential impact on various industries. They explore the connection between language and true intelligence, as well as the limitations of GPT and other large language models. The discussion also covers the importance of task-independent world models, the concept of active inference, and the potential of combining these ideas with transformer and GPT-style models.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Ethics and regulation in AI development are also discussed, including the need for transparency in data used to train AI models and the responsibility of developers to ensure their creations are not destructive. The conversation touches on the challenges posed by AI-generated content on copyright laws and the diminishing role of effort and skill in copyright due to generative models.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The impact of AI on education and creativity is another key area of discussion, with Tim and David exploring the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI in the classroom, the need for a balance between traditional learning methods and AI-assisted learning, and the importance of teaching students to use AI tools critically and responsibly.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Generative AI in music is also explored, with David and Tim discussing the potential for AI-generated music to change the way we create and consume art, as well as the challenges in training AI models to generate music that captures human emotions and experiences.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Tim and David touch on the potential risks and consequences of AI becoming too powerful, the importance of maintaining control over the technology, and the possibility of government intervention and regulation. The discussion concludes with a thought experiment about AI predicting human actions and creating transient capabilities that could lead to doom.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC: </p>\n<p>Introducing Generative Deep Learning [00:00:00]</p>\n<p>Model Families in Generative Modeling [00:02:25]</p>\n<p>Auto Regressive Models and Recurrence [00:06:26]</p>\n<p>Language and True Intelligence [00:15:07]</p>\n<p>Language, Reality, and World Models [00:19:10]</p>\n<p>AI, Human Experience, and Understanding [00:23:09]</p>\n<p>GPTs Limitations and World Modeling [00:27:52]</p>\n<p>Task-Independent Modeling and Cybernetic Loop [00:33:55]</p>\n<p>Collective Intelligence and Emergence [00:36:01]</p>\n<p>Active Inference vs. Reinforcement Learning [00:38:02]</p>\n<p>Combining Active Inference with Transformers [00:41:55]</p>\n<p>Decentralized AI and Collective Intelligence [00:47:46]</p>\n<p>Regulation and Ethics in AI Development [00:53:59]</p>\n<p>AI-Generated Content and Copyright Laws [00:57:06]</p>\n<p>Effort, Skill, and AI Models in Copyright [00:57:59]</p>\n<p>AI Alignment and Scale of AI Models [00:59:51]</p>\n<p>Democratization of AI: GPT-3 and GPT-4 [01:03:20]</p>\n<p>Context Window Size and Vector Databases [01:10:31]</p>\n<p>Attention Mechanisms and Hierarchies [01:15:04]</p>\n<p>Benefits and Limitations of Language Models [01:16:04]</p>\n<p>AI in Education: Risks and Benefits [01:19:41]</p>\n<p>AI Tools and Critical Thinking in the Classroom [01:29:26]</p>\n<p>Impact of Language Models on Assessment and Creativity [01:35:09]</p>\n<p>Generative AI in Music and Creative Arts [01:47:55]</p>\n<p>Challenges and Opportunities in Generative Music [01:52:11]</p>\n<p>AI-Generated Music and Human Emotions [01:54:31]</p>\n<p>Language Modeling vs. Music Modeling [02:01:58]</p>\n<p>Democratization of AI and Industry Impact [02:07:38]</p>\n<p>Recursive Self-Improving Superintelligence [02:12:48]</p>\n<p>AI Technologies: Positive and Negative Impacts [02:14:44]</p>\n<p>Runaway AGI and Control Over AI [02:20:35]</p>\n<p>AI Dangers, Cybercrime, and Ethics [02:23:42]</p>\n",
