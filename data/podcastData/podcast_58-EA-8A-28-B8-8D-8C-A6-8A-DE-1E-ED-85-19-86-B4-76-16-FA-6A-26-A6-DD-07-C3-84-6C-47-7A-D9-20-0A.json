    "Description": "<p>What can a sysadmin learn from a developer? Richard chats with Rick Taylor about his experiences learning from developers to write better code - sysadmin code, of course, like PowerShell, Python, and even YAML.

The conversation explores the various developer techniques that can help sysadmins be more productive - call it DevOps if you like, but it mostly looks like getting work done!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/powershell\">PowerShell for GCP</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/\">PowerShell for AWS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/?view=azps-8.2.0\">PowerShell for Azure</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/\">Azure DevOps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 9, 2022</p>\n",
