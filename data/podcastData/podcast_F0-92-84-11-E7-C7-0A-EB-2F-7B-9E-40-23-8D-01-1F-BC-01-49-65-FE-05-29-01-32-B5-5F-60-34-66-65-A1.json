    "Description": "<p>Sophia is a student in Oman. During the 2020 shut down, Sophia wanted to help the children in her neighborhood have a fun learning experience -- so she created a virtual summer camp online. We can learn about learning in this example where the teacher and students are kids and everything is optional. What an exciting story.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e736\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e736</a></p> Sophia - Bio As Submitted <p>Sophia is a 15 year old rising sophomore from Cooperstown, NY, who attends Al Batinah International School in Sohar, Oman. She started a virtual camp for the children in the neighborhood as a way to offer summer activities based around art, science, STEAM, drama and Getting Ready for School! Each week she sends out several different activities based on the theme of the week. At the end of each week she sets up online meetings for the campers to attend if they want to share what they've created, what they've learned, or even just to talk about what they've been doing.  She hopes to develop the camp into virtual after-school activities once the online school year begins and get other teenagers from school involved in this venture as well. This is her first volunteering initiative and she has enjoyed creating activities for and meeting with the campers. </p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
