    "Description": "<p>During his early career, Jason Citron stepped away from two stalled businesses and pivoted\u2014twice\u2014to something far more successful.&nbsp;The second time he did it, he created&nbsp;one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. It started at age 13 when Jason had a \u201choly crap\u201d moment, discovering he could make his own video games.&nbsp;His first video game company morphed into a social platform for gamers, and after he sold it, he couldn't resist launching another. When <em>that</em> business failed to get traction, he again re-imagined it as a digital space for gamers to gather, and in 2015, Discord was born.&nbsp;Today, the platform has 150 million monthly users, and is a gathering place not just for gamers, but for anyone who wants to connect with friends.&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
