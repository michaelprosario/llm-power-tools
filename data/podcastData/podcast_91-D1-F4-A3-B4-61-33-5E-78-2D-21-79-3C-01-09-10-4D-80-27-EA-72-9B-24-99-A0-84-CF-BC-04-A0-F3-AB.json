    "Description": "\n        <p>Leaders create change. The problem is that not everybody wants change. You\u2019ve probably faced the frustration of having your team be less than enthusiastic about a new initiative. That\u2019s when you hear all the familiar lines: \u201cWe tried that before.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll cost too much.\u201d \u201cWhy do we need this, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s exhausting. But there is hope! Here\u2019s an easy way to get people onboard with a new initiative. It\u2019s so simple, you\u2019ll wonder you you haven\u2019t thought of it before now.</p> <p>Here it is: When introducing any change, from procedures or policies up to and including new product releases, ask people to think of it as an experiment.</p> <p>Hold on! We know that sounds either simplistic or downright dangerous, but there\u2019s a real logic behind it. And? It really works. We\u2019ve used it dozens of times, both when we find ourselves procrastinating on personal change, and even when we launched one of our most successful products.</p> <p>Try this yourself, and you\u2019ll instantly overcome resistance and gain buy-in for your change initiatives. You\u2019ll finally escape the purgatory of endless discussion about a new idea and quickly move to action.</p> <p>This episode of Lead to Win is brought to you by The LeaderScore Assessment, a simple tool to evaluate the health of your leadership.
