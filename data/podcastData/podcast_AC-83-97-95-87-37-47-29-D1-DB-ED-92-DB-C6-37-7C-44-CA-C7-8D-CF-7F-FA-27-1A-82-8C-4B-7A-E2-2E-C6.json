    "Description": "<p>In 2002, John MacFarlane and his co-founders began tinkering on what was then an ambitious idea: create a new way to enjoy music throughout the home, without wires.

But the team at Sonos engineered a top-quality wireless sound system, and\u2013with many fits and starts\u2013integrated it with mobile technology and, eventually, Siri and Alexa.
