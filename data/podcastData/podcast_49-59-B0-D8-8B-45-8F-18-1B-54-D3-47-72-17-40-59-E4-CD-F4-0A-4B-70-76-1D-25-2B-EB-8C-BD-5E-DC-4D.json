    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with founder and CEO at Daisy Intelligence, Gary Saarenvirta. You'll learn about dangerous implicit assumptions, the power of theory and theory versus data. You'll also learn about two types of decisions, the spacial interaction model, traffic flow model, the concept of dividing the world in two and what humans should be doing, and what artificial intelligence should be doing. You will hear about the difference between artificial intelligence that leverages just data versus artificial intelligence that leverages theory and data, and what advantages that creates.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/291\">www.superdatascience.com/291</a></p>\n      ",
