    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Jerod Santo, host of The Changelog, a podcast about open source software development that has been going strong for 15 years.</p> <p>Jerod is plugged in to the world of Open Source, going to all the big conferences and interviewing all the big open source creators.\u00a0</p> <p>We have a fun, wide-reaching conversation about some of the current issues facing open source, such as AI models and Relicensing \u2013 essentially, a big company closed-sourcing a previously open source project after they buy out its creator. (Fun fact: this can't happen to freeCodeCamp because charities cannot be bought or sold.)</p> <p>I ask Jerod about:</p> <p>- his life as a remote dev in Omaha, Nebraska, raising his 6 his kids - the Changelog News podcast with its weekly 10 minutes of updates on the world of open source - his process, and how he researches and surfaces interesting news for his show - and how The Changelog commissioned 3 full albums worth of music over the years, which you can stream for free.</p> <p>Can you guess what bass line I'm playing during the intro? It's from a 1984 pop classic.</p> <p>Be sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 9,331 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
