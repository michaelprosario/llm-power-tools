    "Description": "<p>How do you measure the productivity of your team? Richard talks to Angela Dugan about her work at 3Cloud, supporting groups that are primarily work-from-home and working with remote clients. What do you measure when you can't be face-to-face? Angela talks about using objective and subjective measures - time spent on a project- and how people feel about the work they are doing and the people they are doing it with. The conversation also turns to skill growth as part of measuring a team - making new skills portion of the work, sharing them with the team, and growing your value as an employee!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva\">Microsoft Viva</a></li></ul><p>Recorded February 23, 2023</p>\n",
