    "Description": "<p>Can you pen test yourself? Paula Januszkiewicz says yes! Richard talks to Paula about taking an active role in understanding your organization's security vulnerabilities. Paula talks about the low-hanging fruit she often finds as a professional penetration tester - typically on poorly maintained infrastructure like PKI servers. The conversation digs into tooling you can use to find vulnerabilities - just make sure you trust the source of those tools. Not everyone is a good guy in open source! And, of course, there's always a time to bring in professionals to do a deeper level of testing. Don't wait until the breach happens to take some action!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://cqure.pl/\">Cqure</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/pen-testing?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Penetration Testing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning\">GitHub Secrets Scanning</a></li><li><a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">HaveIBeenPwned</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 22, 2024</p>\n",
