    "Description": "This week's podcast is a slam dunk with two legends joining us to talk leadership and maybe even a little basketball. First up is business titan Jack Welch, former CEO of GE. Jack shares his thoughts on winning the game, building a team, and growing your career. Then you'll meet Kevin Eastman, the vice president of basketball operations for the L.A. Clippers. Kevin shares his thoughts on teamwork, excellence and culture. Listen in because this one definitely is a three-pointer. Another great episode sponsored by our friends at Infusionsoft. http://www.entreleadership.com/podcast\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
