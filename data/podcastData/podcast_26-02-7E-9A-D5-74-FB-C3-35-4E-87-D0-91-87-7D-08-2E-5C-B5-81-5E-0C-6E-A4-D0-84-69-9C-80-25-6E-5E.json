    "Description": "<p>In Part 1 of this Two Part podcast, I visit the home of Chris Sells and we make up a topic for the show! I suggested we talk about what programming will look like in 15 years, and Chris countered with the suggestion that we chat about the LAST 15 years first, then the next 15. We have a blast when we chat, so this show went long, almost 50 minutes, so we cut it in half so as not to waste the listeners time. Be sure to check out Part Two!</p>\n",
