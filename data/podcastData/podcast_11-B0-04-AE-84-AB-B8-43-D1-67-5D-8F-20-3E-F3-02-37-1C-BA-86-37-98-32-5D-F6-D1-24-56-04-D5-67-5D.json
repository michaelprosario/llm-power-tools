Thank you, Advancement Courses for sponsoring this show.</p> Rupa Mehta - Bio As Submitted <p>Rupa Mehta is a teacher, entrepreneur, and author who has helped thousands of adults and youth become healthier individuals. She is the founder of Nalini Method and NaliniKIDS, both based on Rupa\u2019s wellness philosophy that true health is achieved by being both emotionally and physically connected.  \u201cThere is an age-old question in education: \u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d We continue to place increasing value\u2014and pressure\u2014on paving a student\u2019s path to professional success. But I think there is an important question that we have to ask first, and it\u2019s a question that we should be asking people of all ages throughout their lifetime: \u201cWho are you now, and what can you teach us?\u201d I believe that in order for students to truly succeed when they grow up, we need to teach them the subject of self in schools.\u201d ~ Rupa</p>",
