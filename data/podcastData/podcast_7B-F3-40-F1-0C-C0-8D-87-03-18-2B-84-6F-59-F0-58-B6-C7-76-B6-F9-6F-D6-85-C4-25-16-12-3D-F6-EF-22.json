This PO regularly collaborated with subject matter experts and held frequent calls to align with team members on the roadmap. By fostering a shared product vision, this PO exemplified effective leadership and teamwork.</p>   The Bad Product Owner: Engaging the PO to Create Clarity and Purpose for the Agile Team <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Stella shares the story of a Product Owner who was present but not engaged with the team. This PO missed key team events, leading to confusion and demotivation among the team members. Stella understood that the team lacked context and clear priorities, resulting in a poor ability to understand stakeholder feedback. When analyzing the causes for this anti-pattern, Stella highlights the pitfalls of spreading a PO too thin and the importance of mid-sprint reviews.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  [IMAGE HERE] Are you having trouble helping the team work well with their Product Owner?
