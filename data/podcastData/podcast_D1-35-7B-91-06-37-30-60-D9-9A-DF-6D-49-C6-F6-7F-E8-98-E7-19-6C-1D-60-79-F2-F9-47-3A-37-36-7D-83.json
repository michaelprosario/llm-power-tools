A great PO is open about the challenges but ensures that team members are not overwhelmed. They create space for experimentation, facilitate two-way communication, and know how to protect the team by saying \u201cno\u201d when needed.</p>   The Bad Product Owner: Bringing Pressure to the Team <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  On the other hand, Hassan highlights an anti-pattern where a Product Owner brings external pressures into the team, causing stress and blame. A bad PO passes down the pressure they feel, which can create a toxic environment. Hassan advises using 3-amigo sessions to support the PO and suggests promoting open conversations that avoid blame and foster transparency.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
