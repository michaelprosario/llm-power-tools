    "Description": "Chiu-Ki Chan believes in speaking. Best case scenario, speaking gives her a way to share her journey and accomplishments. Worst case scenario, it\u2019s a way to help her make small talk with other conference goers. Either way, she wins. She talks to us about starting Technically Speaking, a digest highlighting talks and open calls for proposals, about how she successfully shares her career achievements without feeling too self-promoting, and how she helps others do the same.
