    "Description": "\n        Every leader is motivated by a compelling vision for the future. There\u2019s something you want to achieve. You know where you\u2019re headed. The problem is that it\u2019s hard to keep that vision real for your team. They\u2019re busy and easily distracted. Before long, another quarter has slipped by and you haven\u2019t made real progress on the big outcome you\u2019re after. How discouraging!\u00a0 But there\u2019s hope! We\u2019ve got a compelling formula for communicating your vision to every single member of your team.\u00a0 Based on decades of corporate experience, we\u2019ve distilled vision casting into a series of four steps.
