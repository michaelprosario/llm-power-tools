    "Description": "<p>How can automation help you? Richard chats with Jennelle Crothers about her work automating tasks with Azure. So what does automation mean to you? Jennelle talks about automating the delivery of resources to internal developers - whether that be on-premise or in the cloud. This is part of a DevOps practice, being able to use templates so that development is using resources configured as close to production as possible. Automation also applies to testing, deployment, instrumentation, disaster recovery and more. Will IT ever run out of work? Not a chance - there's always more to do!</p>\n",
