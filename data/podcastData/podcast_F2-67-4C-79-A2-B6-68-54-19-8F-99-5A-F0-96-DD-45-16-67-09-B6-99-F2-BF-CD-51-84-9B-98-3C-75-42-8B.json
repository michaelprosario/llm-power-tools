    "Description": "<p>Jonathan Barronville is a Junior Developer, and he's not apologetic about it. What does it really mean to be Junior Developer, and why is everyone in such a rush to be a Senior? Are we really gaining experience or just experiencing the same years, one after another? What can we do as an industry to be more welcoming to Junior devs, while realizing that we must all be amateurs ourselves?</p>\n",
