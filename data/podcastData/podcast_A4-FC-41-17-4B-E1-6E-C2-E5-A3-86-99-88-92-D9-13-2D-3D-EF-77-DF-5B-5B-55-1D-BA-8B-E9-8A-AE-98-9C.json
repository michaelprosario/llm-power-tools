    "Description": "<p>Microsoft has an interesting strategy with their new \u201cautonomous systems\u201d technology also known as Project Bonsai. They want to create an interface to abstract away the complexity and esoterica of deep reinforcement learning. They want to fuse together expert knowledge and artificial intelligence all on one platform, so that complex problems can be decomposed into simpler ones. They want to take machine learning Ph.Ds out of the equation and make autonomous systems engineering look more like a traditional software engineering process. It is an ambitious undertaking, but interesting. Reinforcement learning is extremely difficult (as I cover in the video), and if you don\u2019t have a team of RL Ph.Ds with tech industry experience, you shouldn\u2019t even consider doing it yourself. This is our take on it!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>There are 3 chapters in this video;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Chapter 1: Tim's intro and take on RL being hard, intro to Bonsai and machine teaching&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter 2: Interview with Scott Stanfield [recorded Jan 2020] 00:56:41\t</p>\n<p>Chapter 3: Traditional street talk episode [recorded Dec 2020] 01:38:13</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This is *not* an official communication from Microsoft, all personal opinions.
