    "Description": "In this episode we're talking to <a href=\"http://www.lindarising.org/\">Linda Rising</a> about retrospectives. We start by defining what a retrospective is and discuss some of the logistics of making it work for software projects. We then look at the different phases of a retrospective. The main part then is a discussion about some of the practices or games that are used to facilitate the retrospective. We conclude the retrospective discussion with destroying some of the prejudices against it and the relationship to process improvement and CMM. \nAt the end of the interview we talk a little about Linda's current interest: how does the brain work?",
