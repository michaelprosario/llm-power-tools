    "Description": "<p>Paige Bailey, who began coding at age 9 in rural Texas, now leads the GenAI developer experience at Google. In a conversation with Chris Pirillo on The New Stack Makers, Bailey reflected on the evolving role of software development in the era of generative AI. While she once urged her nieces and nephews to pursue computer science degrees, Bailey now believes that critical thinking and problem-solving may be more crucial for future tech careers.\u00a0</p><p>She emphasized that generative AI is democratizing software development, making it more accessible and enabling developers to focus on creative tasks rather than the minutiae of coding. Bailey's experience at Google highlights this shift, as she now acts more as a reviewer and overseer of AI-generated code. She sees GenAI not as a replacement for developers but as a tool to accelerate their creativity and tackle longstanding backlogs. Bailey believes the key is ensuring everyone understands how to effectively apply generative AI to their work.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the future of development:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/7-ways-to-future-proof-your-developer-job-in-the-age-of-ai/\">7 Ways to Future Proof Your Developer Job in the Age of AI\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-developer-careers/\">The Future of Developer Careers\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/4-forecasts-for-the-future-of-developer-relations/\">4 Forecasts for the Future of Developer Relations</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
