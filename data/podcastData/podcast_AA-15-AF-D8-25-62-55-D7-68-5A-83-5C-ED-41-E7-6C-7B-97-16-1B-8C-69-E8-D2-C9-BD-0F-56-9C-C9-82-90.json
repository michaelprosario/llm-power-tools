So what's up with that? How do you build a Web3 stack? What can you build with a Web3 stack? How far along is the community with tooling and ease-of-use?</p><p>This virtual panel podcast sets out to answer all these questions.</p><p>In addition to speaking to Ayala, we spoke with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowlandgraus/\">Rowland Graus</a>, head of product for <a href=\"https://agoric.com/\">Agoric</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-baricevic-ab0b49214/?originalSubdomain=de\">Marko Baricevic</a>, software engineer for <a href=\"https://interchain.io/\">The Interchain Foundation</a>, which manages <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\">Cosmos Network</a>. an open source technology to help blockchains interoperate. Each participant describes the role in the Web3 ecosystem where their respective technologies play. These technologies are often used together, so they represent an emerging blockchain stack of sorts.</p><p>TNS Editor-in-Chief <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/joab/\">Joab Jackson</a> hosted the discussion.</p>\n",
