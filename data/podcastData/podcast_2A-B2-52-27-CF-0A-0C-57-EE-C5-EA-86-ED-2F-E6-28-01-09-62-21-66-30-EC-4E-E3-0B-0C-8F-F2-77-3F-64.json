    "Description": "  Chris Sims: The Hidden Cost of \"No Time for People Stuff\" in Software Teams <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Chris Sims shares a challenging team situation involving strong personalities with conflicting opinions about how to approach their work. What began as small disagreements evolved into harmful behaviors including harsh criticisms and behind-the-back comments. As resentment grew, conflicts intensified, leading to a toxic environment that ultimately resulted in team members being dismissed. Chris highlights how the team's self-imposed belief that \"we don't have time for this people-stuff\" prevented them from addressing issues early. He recommends one-on-one coaching, exploring why people react as they do, using retrospectives to address latent conflicts, and explicitly discussing desired team culture with reference to the Scrum value of respect. Chris emphasizes that maintaining team health should take priority over productivity concerns, even during high-pressure situations.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to the <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2018/04/podcast/bonus-richard-kasperowski-on-on-high-performance-teams-and-the-core-protocols/\">  Core Protocols episode with Richard Kasperowski</a>, and the <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_heffernan_forget_the_pecking_order_at_work?language=en\">  Superchicken Paradox Ted Talk by Margaret Heffernan</a>.</p>   Featured Book of the Week: The Elements of Scrum <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Chris shares his experience writing <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4ifxuW6\"> \"The Elements of Scrum,\"</a>  a book he co-authored using Scrum principles and a story mapping approach.
