    "Description": "<p>Take our year-end freeCodeCamp podcast listener survey real quick: https://forms.gle/2M9NW776723uSdDT7</p> <p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Kevin Powell. He's a designer, a software engineer, and an expert in CSS. He's runs a CSS-focused YouTube channel with nearly a million subscribers. There's nothing sensational there \u2013 he literally just teaches people CSS.</p> <p>Support for this podcast comes from a grant from Wix Studio. Wix Studio provides developers tools to rapidly build websites with everything out-of-the-box, then extend, replace, and break boundaries with code. Learn more at https://wixstudio.com.</p> <p>Support also comes from the 11,043 kind folks who support freeCodeCamp through a monthly donation. Join these kind folks and help our mission by going to https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate</p> <p>CORRECTION: I (Quincy) say during the interview that the Uber found a way to access microphones on iOS without users' knowledge. There have been documented cases of malware doing this (like Pegasus) but Uber didn't do this. They did do a lot of other shady things, like continue collecting data even after you deleted their app \u2013 but mic spying was not one of them. Yes, early Uber was an ethical tire fire. But it's important to get facts right here.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- Why you should still learn CSS in 2025 - How teaching concepts improves your own understanding of them - How learning to skateboard helped Kevin escape Tutorial Hell - Massive improvements coming to CSS</p> <p>Links we talk about during our conversation:</p> <p>- Kevin's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/kevinpowell</p> <p>- Original Space Jam website Kevin mentions: https://www.spacejam.com/1996/</p> <p>- The article that coined the term Responsive Design: https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/</p> <p>- Kevin's freeCodeCamp article on how learning skateboarding helped him out of tutorial hell: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-learning-to-skateboard-helped-me-find-a-way-out-of-tutorial-hell/</p> <p>- Kevin's freeCodeCamp course on building and deploying a portfolio page: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-portfolio-website-and-deploy-to-digital-ocean/</p> <p>- Playable Minesweeper in CSS that Quincy mentions: https://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/BLJONZ</p> <p>- Acknowledged mistakes that are permanently coded into CSS: https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes</p> <p>- Talk on why is CSS so weird: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHUtMbJw8iA</p>",
