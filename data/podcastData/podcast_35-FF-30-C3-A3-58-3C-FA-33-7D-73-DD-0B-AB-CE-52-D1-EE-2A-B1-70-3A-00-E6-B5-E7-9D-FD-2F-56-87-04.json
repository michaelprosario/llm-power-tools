    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Hiroko Nishimura. She's a special ed teacher turned system administrator turned technical instructor.\u00a0</p> <p>Hiroko grew up in Japan and moved to the US as a kid. In her early 20s, she was diagnosed with a vascular tumor in her brain. After life-saving surgery, she had to work to regain the ability to walk and talk. She still lives with disabilities to this day.\u00a0</p> <p>Despite this, she's gone on to author technical books, become an AWS hero, and create the popular AWS Newbies community. More than 500,000 people have taken her LinkedIn Learning course.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How Hiroko moved to the US as a kid and learned English and American culture</p> <p>- Hiroko's vascular tumor diagnosis, and how she recovered from brain surgery and brain damage</p> <p>- Her big move to NYC and her years working as a system administrator and ultimately cloud engineer there</p> <p>- How she made the jump to teaching system administration full-time as a course creator</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1990 song by a Scottish rock band.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 10,443 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
