    "Description": "\n        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed education forever. But Sal Khan says an even bigger educational revolution is just around the corner \u2026</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Sal returns to the show to talk about a new learning platform he\u2019s building at Khan Academy. It\u2019s called Khanmigo, and it uses the same generative AI technology behind OpenAI\u2019s world-changing ChatGPT to help students with their schoolwork. The technology isn\u2019t without its risks, but Sal thinks Khanmigo could act as a personal tutor for every student and a teaching assistant for every educator - reshaping the classroom for good.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
