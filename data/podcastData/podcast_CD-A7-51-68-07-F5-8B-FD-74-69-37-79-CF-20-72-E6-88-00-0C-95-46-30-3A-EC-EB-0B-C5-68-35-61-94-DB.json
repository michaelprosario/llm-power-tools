    "Description": "<p>We've updated the popular show from the spring with current research in October 2020 with Dr. Eric Rossen, the Director of professional development and standards for the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) which has created a recent <a href= \"https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources-and-podcasts/covid-19-resource-center\"> COVID19 Resource Center</a>.

Impero back:drop eliminates the need for paper-based reporting, plus provides a safe and secure place to record and store information about student safety concerns. I love Impero back:drop because it really helps inform educators about a student\u2019s health, from first aid, to sickness, to more complex mental health issues they may be experiencing. It\u2019s FERPA, COPPA and HIPAA compliant, plus information can only be shared with permitted staff members. I hope you\u2019ll check out Impero back:drop.
