    "Description": "<p>What is error culture, and how do you avoid it within your organization? How do you navigate alert and notification fatigue? Hey, it&rsquo;s episode #200! Real Python&rsquo;s editor-in-chief, Dan Bader, joins us this week to celebrate. Christopher Trudeau also returns to bring another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>We discuss an article series about error culture. We dig into false positives, hero culture, and the tendency to start ignoring alerts. We contrast our personal experiences and propose possible remedies. Dan describes configuring Real Python&rsquo;s alert system.</p>\n<p>We also share several other articles and projects from the Python community, including a news roundup, reading and writing WAV files in Python, moving beyond flat files toward SQLite and SQLAlchemy, getting help in Python, exploring four kinds of optimization, a framework for building web scrapers, and a project to simply subprocesses.</p>\n<p>This week&rsquo;s episode is brought to you by Sentry.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong>  <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/sqlite-sqlalchemy-python-beyond-flat-files/\">SQLite and SQLAlchemy in Python: Move Your Data Beyond Flat Files</a></p>\n<p>In this video course, you&rsquo;ll learn how to store and retrieve data using Python, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy as well as with flat files. Using SQLite with Python brings with it the additional benefit of accessing data with SQL. By adding SQLAlchemy, you can work with data in terms of objects and methods.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:02:42 &ndash; PyPI Hiring a Support Specialist </li>\n<li>00:03:19 &ndash; PyPI Temporarily Halted New Users and Projects</li>\n<li>00:04:14 &ndash; What we know about the xz Utils backdoor</li>\n<li>00:05:38 &ndash; CPython, PyPI, and the backdoor of xz</li>\n<li>00:07:18 &ndash; Episode 200 appreciation and the journey</li>\n<li>00:09:18 &ndash; A visit from Dan</li>\n<li>00:14:14 &ndash; Reading and Writing WAV Files in Python</li>\n<li>00:19:56 &ndash; Sponsor: Sentry</li>\n<li>00:21:03 &ndash; SQLite and SQLAlchemy in Python</li>\n<li>00:27:36 &ndash; Getting Help (In Python)</li>\n<li>00:32:49 &ndash; Laurence Tratt: Four Kinds of Optimization</li>\n<li>00:40:54 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:42:26 &ndash; Discussion: Error Culture</li>\n<li>00:58:03 &ndash; botasaurus: The All in One Framework to Build Awesome Scrapers</li>\n<li>01:01:04 &ndash; suby: Slightly Simplified Subprocesses</li>\n<li>01:02:50 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>News:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pythonsoftwarefoundation.applytojob.com/apply/nyYHuOha9h/PyPI-Support-Specialist\">PyPI Hiring a Support Specialist (Remote)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/pypi-halted-new-users-and-projects-while-it-fended-off-supply-chain-attack/\">PyPI Temporarily Halted New Users and Projects</a> &ndash; To fend off a supply-chain attack, PyPI temporarily halted new users and projects for about 10 hours last week.
