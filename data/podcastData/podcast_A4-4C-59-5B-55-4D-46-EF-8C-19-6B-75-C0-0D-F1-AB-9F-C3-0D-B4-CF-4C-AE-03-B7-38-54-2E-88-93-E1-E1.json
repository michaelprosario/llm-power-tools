    "Description": "<p>We talked to Arlan Hamilton two years ago (almost to the day) as she was starting her Venture Fund for underrepresented founders. What's changed since then? Arlan Hamilton's Backstage Capital has invested more than $4M+ in over 80 companies led by underrepresented founders. How has she gone from Homeless to VC in just a few years? Arlan also recently started Project Cover to give micro-grants to driven creatives. Scott catches up with Arlan to hear about how she's continued to build her team and her fund and BUILD COOL STUFF. And also - what's the right way to eat string cheese?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://hanselminutes.com/524</li>\n<li>http://backstagecapital.com</li>\n<li>http://projectcover.org</li>\n</ul>\n",
