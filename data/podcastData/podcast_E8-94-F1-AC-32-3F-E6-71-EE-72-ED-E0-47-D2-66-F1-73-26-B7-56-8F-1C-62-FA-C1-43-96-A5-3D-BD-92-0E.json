    "Description": "<p>What does it cost to recover from a disaster? While at NDC Oslo, Richard chatted with Natalie Serebryakova about her work helping companies understand their disaster recovery costs and what that process can teach you about your infrastructure. Natalie talks about different types of disasters, from the deletion of a production server to a major outage caused by a fire at a data center - and the power of working through the scenario to determine what needs to be backed up and what it takes to recover. The conversation also dives into the scrutiny of implementation - often, decisions are made that are no longer understood, or systems have changed enough that they could be improved. The result can be lowering DR costs, improving performance, and reducing operating overhead! </p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://soc2.co.uk/\">SOC2</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/\">DataDog</a></li></ul><p>Recorded June 12, 2024</p>\n",
