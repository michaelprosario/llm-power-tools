    "Description": "<p>In this episode, we cover compassionate accountability & facing difficulties head-on with Marc Lesser, author of <i>Finding Clarity</i>. He shares what it was like living in a Zen monastery for 10 years and the leadership lessons he learned while working in their kitchen. We also address strategies for conversations around high standards, accountability, agreements, and alignment; models for correcting negative self-talk; closing the gap between seemingly combative standards, such as speed vs. quality; and how to transition from avoiding conflicts to accepting them. Lastly, we close with a three-minute meditation that can help bring much-needed well-being into your workspace.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-lesser-zba/\"><strong>MARC LESSER</strong></a></h2><p>Marc Lesser (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marclesser\">@marclesser</a>) is a CEO, executive coach, and Zen teacher. He founded and was CEO of 3 companies, and helped develop a mindfulness program inside of Google's headquarters. Marc was a resident of the San Francisco Zen Center for 10 years, and director of Tassajara, Zen Mountain Center, the first Zen monastery in the western world. He is the author of <i>Finding Clarity</i>.</p><blockquote><p>\"So to me it's really maybe about high standards and aligning around those standards. Avoiding those conversations is the problem and this is where I think the whole realm of emotions and emotional intelligence and self-awareness comes into play. Five emotionally intelligent engineers working together will produce much, much greater outcomes than people who are not really aligned, not really having those real conversations.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Marc Lesser \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Join us at ELC Annual 2023!</h2><p>ELC Annual is our flagship conference for engineering leaders.
