    "Description": "<p>The pandemic rushed some work into the cloud - but getting up to the cloud in an organized way takes some preparation, starting with Active Directory. Richard talks to Jess Dodson about the various clean-up processes we always meant to do for AD, but never got around to it.

Jess talks about getting your admin accounts in order, cleaning up services accounts, modernizing onboarding and offboarding, and taking advantage of multifactor authentication. There is lots to do!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sentinel/\">Azure Sentinel</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview\">Azure Role-Based Access Control</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure\">Azure AD Privileged Identity Management</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/\">Azure Monitor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity/conditional-access\">Azure Conditional Access</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46899\">Local Administrator Password Solutions</a></li></ul>\n",
