    "Description": "When Tariq Farid was 12, he emigrated from Pakistan to the U.S. \u2013 and quickly found a job at a local flower shop. Eventually he opened his own shop, which eventually led to the crazy idea to make flower bouquets out of fruit. Edible Arrangements has now bloomed into a franchise of nearly 1300 locations with an annual revenue of $600 million. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how the Seattle-based clothing company, Five12, is making athletic wear out of used coffee grounds.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
