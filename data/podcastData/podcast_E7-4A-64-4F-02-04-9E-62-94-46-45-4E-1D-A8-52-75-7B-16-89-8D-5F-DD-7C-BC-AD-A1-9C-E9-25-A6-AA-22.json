    "Description": "<p>How's your business continuity? As part of the Pandemic Series, Richard talks to Sonia Cuff about the role of IT in business continuity. As Sonia says, the first word there is BUSINESS. And we're all part of making a business work, so you need to engage with business leadership around what continuity looks like for your organization. Backups are not enough! The conversation also dives into the fact that business continuity is not just about outages - productivity plays a part as well. Helping staff that are new to working from home get more productivity, providing mechanisms for making work and progress visible; all these things are about business continuity. And any improvements here benefit the business today and in the world beyond the pandemic!</p>\n",
