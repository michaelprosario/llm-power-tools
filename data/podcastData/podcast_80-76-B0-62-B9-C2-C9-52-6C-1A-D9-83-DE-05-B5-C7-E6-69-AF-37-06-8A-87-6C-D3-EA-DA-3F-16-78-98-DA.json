    "Description": "<p>Enterprise Mobility is no longer optional! Richard talks to Richard Hicks about his work during the pandemic around remote connectivity. The early days of the pandemic were a scramble to get folks working from home, often needing to scale up VPN services. Now that a few months have gone by, other problems have appeared: Are the remote workstations getting patched? How do you know? What about self-service password changes with remote machines? Richard digs into the details of not being on the local network and how you can tune up your remote connectivity to bring back all the goodness!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp\">Defender Advanced Threat Protection</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy\">Always On VPN</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/\">NetMotion</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/windows-autopilot\">Windows Autopilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/directaccess/directaccess\">DirectAccess</a></li><li><a href=\"https://directaccess.richardhicks.com/2020/04/14/always-on-vpn-split-vs-force-tunneling/\">Richard's Blog on Forced Tunneling</a></li></ul>\n",
