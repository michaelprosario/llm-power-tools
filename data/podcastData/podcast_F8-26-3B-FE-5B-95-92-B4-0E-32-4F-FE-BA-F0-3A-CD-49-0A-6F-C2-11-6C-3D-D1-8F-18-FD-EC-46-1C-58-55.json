    "Description": "\n        <p>The story we often tell ourselves about entrepreneurs often centers on their intelligence, bravery, and leadership. But the truth is that as a leader, you simply cannot reach your goals unless you are willing to trust in other to help you get there. This means peers, mentors, colleagues, employees, friends, and family - we all need a community in order to be successful. </p><p>In this episode, Michael Hyatt and Megan Hyatt Miller talk you through three reasons that you <em>need</em> community in order to achieve your goals. After that, Joel Miller speaks with Dr. Henry Cloud about the importance of trust in all of our relationships.</p><p>For more information on Dr. Clouds' new book, <em>Knowing When to Give It, When to Withhold It, How to Earn It, and How to Fix It When It Gets Broken, </em>visit <a href=\"https://trustbydrhenrycloud.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://trustbydrhenrycloud.com/</a>.</p><p><strong>The Business Accelerator podcast is a reflection of the values and processes inside the BusinessAccelerator coaching program.
