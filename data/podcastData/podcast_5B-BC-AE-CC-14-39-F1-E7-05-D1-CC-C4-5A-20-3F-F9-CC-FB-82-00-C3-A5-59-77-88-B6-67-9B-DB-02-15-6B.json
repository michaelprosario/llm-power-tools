    "Description": "\n        <p>Joe Laurienti, a former SpaceX and Blue Origin engineer, launched Ursa Major in 2015 with the idea that 3D printing could revolutionize the production of rocket engines.</p><p>The timing was right: Russia had invaded Crimea the previous year. American sanctions and strained political relationships threatened the supply of Russian rocket engines, which the U.S. had relied on for space missions since the end of the Cold War. American companies like Ursa Major have now begun providing rocket engines for both government and private space endeavors.&nbsp;</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Joe talks with Guy about the journey of launching and scaling a multimillion dollar aerospace company. Plus, how Joe has dealt with the infamous \u201cstartup valley of death\u201d and how Ursa Major\u2019s engines are helping the U.S. catch up to Russia and China in the development of hypersonic weapons.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was produced by Chris Maccini and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
