    "Description": "<p>How do you respond to a ransomware attack? Richard talks to Dana Epp about dealing with a ransomware attack. Dana discusses making a plan - if you don't have a plan already, dealing with an attack is very difficult. And make sure your plan exists outside of your regular network since one of the first things you're going to do during an attack is shut down the network. The conversation focuses on how ransomware attacks are a crime and need to be treated accordingly - it's a business problem, not just a technical problem.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://cyber.gc.ca/en/\">Canadian Center for CyberSecurity</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity\">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a></li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ransomware-detection-and-recovering-your-files-0d90ec50-6bfd-40f4-acc7-b8c12c73637f\">Ransomware Detection and Recovery in OneDrive</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/backup/\">Azure Backup</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/\">Twilio</a></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p>Recorded July 19, 2021</p>\n",
