    "Description": "<p>Modern developer conferences like the upcoming Infobip Shift Conference in Croatia are centered around themes. At this particular event for developers, you can expect a lot of focus to be on the developer experience and artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>Ivan Burazin, Chief Development Experience Officer at InfoBip, joined us on the show and emphasizes that developers spend a substantial portion of their time not coding, often losing 50 to 70% of their productive hours to non-coding activities, such as setting up environments, running tests, and building code. This highlights the importance of improving the developer experience to enhance productivity.</p><p>The developer experience has both internal and external dimensions. Externally, it impacts customer experience, while internally, it influences development velocity. A better developer experience translates to faster and more efficient coding.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://shift.infobip.com/\">Shift Conference</a> will feature talks on six stages, one of which will focus on the developer experience, addressing its internal and external aspects. Additionally, AI will take center stage at another segment of the conference.</p><p>Although there may not be an abundance of true AI experts taking the stage, the focus will be on how individuals and companies can leverage AI to create products and services. It's recognized that AI will play a pivotal role in the future of every industry, and the conference aims to explore practical applications and strategies for integrating AI into various businesses.</p><p>Overall, the Shift Conference aims to address the challenges developers face in optimizing their productivity and explore the growing importance of AI in shaping the future of businesses and products.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the developer experience and InfoBip Shift:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/7-principles-and-10-tactics-to-make-you-a-10x-developer/\">7 Principles and 10 Tactics to Make You a 10x Developer</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-challenges-of-marketing-software-tools-to-developers/\">The Challenges of Marketing Software Tools to Developers</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-better-developer-experience/\">A Guide to Better Developer Experience</a></p>\n",
