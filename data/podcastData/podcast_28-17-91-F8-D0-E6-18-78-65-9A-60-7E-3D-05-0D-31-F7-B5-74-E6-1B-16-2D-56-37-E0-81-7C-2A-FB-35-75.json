Ken Pickering, SVP of Engineering @ Starburst Data, discusses navigating catastrophe, and uncertainty and building a culture of resiliency within startups & eng teams. We cover how to embrace challenges / failure, and cultivate centralized beliefs within your org. Plus the challenges behind finding PMF for a second product, and how to leverage first-principles to avoid a failed second product.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenpickering/\">KEN PICKERING</a></h2><p>Ken Pickering is the SVP of Engineering at Starburst Data, where he is privileged to work alongside some of the best product and engineering humans in the world. Prior to his role here, he held leadership roles at large-scale consumer SaaS and enterprise security companies.</p><blockquote><p>\"Communication and context are some of the things that are most successful in feeding an engineering organization because engineers are generalized problem solvers. We all want to be engaged with the problem and then apply a methodology to that problem. Even in high stakes situations, articulate the problem clearly, give people the timeline, give people the constraints, and let them rip. The people that can do that and perform in different kinds of environments and be flexible and adaptable are really key to driving that kind of culture.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Ken Pickering \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>We\u2019re hosting the first ELC Annual Watch Party on 11/8!</h2><p>We\u2019re livestreaming the most popular sessions from the ELC Annual 2023 conference + hosting virtual roundtable discussions to connect you with eng leaders around the globe AND in your city.</p><p>Our first topic covers Generative AI & engineering leadership with Wade Chambers\u2026 no this isn\u2019t about the tech - it\u2019s about the leadership skills and competencies you need to evolve and adapt to lead in this next generation!</p><h3><i><strong>We have different events for Europe, East Coast & West Coast!
