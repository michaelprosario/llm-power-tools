With the new version of Sharepoint just around the corner, it's time to dig into what the current version of Sharepoint does well and what is challenging. Sahil talks about solutions for challenges in Sharepoint 2007, including dealing with keeping profiles in separate farms. He points to his tool on codeplex, MOSS Profile Import at www.codeplex.com/mossprofileimport. There will be another show in the future to talk about how some of these issues are resolved in Sharepoint 2010.</p>\n",
