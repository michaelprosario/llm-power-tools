    "Description": "<p>Dr. Anael Alston @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/DrAAlston\">DrAAlston</a> talks about common misconceptions that educators have about students in poverty. Born and raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn, Anael \"Dr. A\" Alston is an award-winning educator and serves as Superintendent of Schools of the Hamilton Central School District in Hamilton, NY. Prior to that, he was the principal of the Robert M. Finley Middle School in Glen Cove, New York and principal of Great Neck North Middle School in Great Neck, New York.</p> <p>Dr. A is passionate about leadership, service, and all things public education. In today's show, we discuss how teachers should approach teaching students who are in high-poverty situations. This is important because Anael argues that many thoughts about students in poverty are off-base.</p> <p>In today's show we discuss:</p> <ul> <li>The mindsets and attitudes students need for success</li> <li>How educator expectations are an essential ingredient of student success</li> <li>The importance of relationship with students</li> <li>Anael's advice for what teachers should do daily to adjust their thinking and prepare to teach difficult students.</li> </ul> <p>A full transcript of this show and the show notes are available at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast\">www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast</a> as well as details on entering this month\u2019s giveaway contests.</p>",
