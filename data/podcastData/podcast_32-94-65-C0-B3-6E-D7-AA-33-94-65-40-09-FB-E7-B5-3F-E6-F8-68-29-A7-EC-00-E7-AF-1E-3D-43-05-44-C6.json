I think for the initial phases of project, it's actually advantageous to have a smaller team.</p><p>- Paul Dix \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Interested in joining an <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">ELC Peer Group?</a></h2><p>ELCs <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">Peer Groups</a> provide a virtual, curated, and ongoing peer learning opportunity to help you navigate the unknown, uncover solutions and accelerate your learning with a small group of trusted peers.</p><p><strong>Apply to join a peer group HERE:</strong> <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\"><strong>sfelc.com/peerGroups</strong></a></p><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>The history behind InfluxDB & its multi-phase, long-term transformation (1:53)</li><li>InfluxDB\u2019s first transformational phase featuring time series data (5:48)</li><li>Phase 2.0 & shifting to a cloud-first delivery model (7:50)</li><li>Challenges & opportunities faced in the current phase of InfluxDB (9:31)</li><li>How Paul decided it was time to take the company to the next level (11:38)</li><li>Making a bet on Rust (14:25)</li><li>Why making an early announcement helped push Phase 3.0 forward (16:02)</li><li>Strategies for identifying the right people for your eng team (19:06)</li><li>How to optimize community insights when tailoring your vision (21:56)</li><li>Tips for resolving disagreements between eng team members (24:45)</li><li>Frameworks for executing long-term vision & achieving alignment (26:21)</li><li>Processes for integrating other teams into an org\u2019s re-architecture (29:55)</li><li>The impact of Conway\u2019s Law on team structure & open-source software (32:07)</li><li>Considerations for managing large, open-source projects (36:40)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (37:56)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.happinesshypothesis.com/\">The Happiness Hypothesis</a>\u201d by Jonathan Haidt - Each chapter is an attempt to savor one idea that has been discovered by several of the world\u2019s civilizations -\u00ad to question it in light of what we now know from scientific research, and to extract from it the lessons that still apply to our modern lives.</li><li>\u201c<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691166834/the-fate-of-rome\">The Fate of Rome</a>\u201d by Kyle Harper - How devastating viruses, pandemics, and other natural catastrophes swept through the far-flung Roman Empire and helped to bring down one of the mightiest civilizations of the ancient world</li></ul>\n",
