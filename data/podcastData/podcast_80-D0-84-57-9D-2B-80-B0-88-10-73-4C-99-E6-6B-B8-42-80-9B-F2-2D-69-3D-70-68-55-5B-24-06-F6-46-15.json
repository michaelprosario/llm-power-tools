    "Description": "<p>David Heath and Randy Goldberg saw an opportunity to disrupt a long dormant\u2014and arguably boring sector...socks. They met at a startup in their&nbsp;20s, each already had their own side hustles before they hatched a plan to launch a business together.&nbsp;Randy and David didn\u2019t initially intend to get into the sock business, but in 2011, David read that socks are the most requested clothing item at homeless shelters. That led them to start a company they called Bombas based on a promise: for each pair of socks a customer bought, another would be donated to the homeless. Within about ten years, their one-for-one start-up turned into a quarter of a billion dollar business that has expanded into sweatshirts, underwear, and t-shirts.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-great-creators-with-guy-raz/id1640546593\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Great Creators</a> launching September 20th</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
