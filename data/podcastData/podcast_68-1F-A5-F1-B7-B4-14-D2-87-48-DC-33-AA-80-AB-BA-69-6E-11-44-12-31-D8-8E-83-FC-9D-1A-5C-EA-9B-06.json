    "Description": "<p>During the pandemic, <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/digital-transformation-during-the-pandemic/\">many organizations sped up their move to the cloud</a> \u2014\u00a0without fully understanding the costs, both human and financial, they would pay for the convenience and scalability of a digital transformation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey really didn\u2019t have a baseline,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mekkacodes/\">Mekka Williams,</a> principal engineer, at Spot by NetApp,\u00a0in this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast. \u201cAnd so the those first <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/want-to-save-the-world-start-by-cutting-your-cloud-costs/\">cloud bills</a>, I'm sure were shocking, because you don't get a cloud bill, when you run on your on-premises environment, or even your private cloud, where you've already paid the cost for the infrastructure that you're using.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>What\u2019s especially worrisome is that many of those costs are simply wasted, Williams said. \u201cMost of the containerized applications running in Kubernetes clusters are running underutilized,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd anything that's underutilized in the cloud equates to waste. And if we want to be really lean and clean and use resources in a very efficient manner, we have to have really good cloud strategy in order to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This episode of The New Stack Makers, hosted by Heather Joslyn, TNS features editor, focused on CloudOps, which in this case stands for \u201ccloud operations.\u201d (It can also stand for \u201ccloud optimization,\u201d but more about that later.)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The conversation was sponsored by Spot by NetApp.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h2>Automation for Cloud Optimization</h2><p>\u00a0</p><p>Many organizations that moved quickly to the cloud during the dog days of the pandemic have begun to revisit the decisions they made and update their strategies, Williams said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe see some organizations that are trying to modernize their applications further, to make better use of the services that are available in the cloud,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cloud is getting more complex as they grow and mature in their journey.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd so they're looking for ways to simplify their operations. And as always keep their costs down. Keep things simple for their DevOps and SRE, to \u00a0is not incur additional technical debt, but still make the most make the best use out of their cloud, wherever they are.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Automation holds the key to CloudOps \u2014 both definitions \u2014\u00a0according to Williams. For starters, it makes teams more efficient.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe less tasks that your workforce have to perform manually, the more time they have to spend focused on business logic and being innovative,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAutomation also helps you with repeatability. And it's less error-prone, and it helps you standardize. Really good automation simplifies your environment greatly.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Automating repetitive tasks can also help prevent your <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/experts-weigh-in-on-the-state-of-site-reliability-engineering/\">site reliability engineers (SREs)</a> from <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-to-recognize-recover-from-and-prevent-burnout/\">burnout,</a> she said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Practicing \u201cgood data hygiene,\u201d Williams said, also helps contain costs and reduce toil: \u201cMaking\u00a0sure you're using the right tier of data, making sure you're not over-provisioned. And the type of storage you need, you don't need to pay top dollar for high-performing storage, if it's just backup data that doesn't get accessed that often.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Such practices are \u201cgood to know on-premises, but these are imperative to know when you're in the cloud,\u201d she said, in order to reduce waste.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>During this episode, Williams pointed to solutions in the Spot by Netapp portfolio that use automation to help make the most of cloud infrastructure, such as its flagship product, Elastigroup, which takes advantage of excess capacity to scale workloads.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In June, Spot by NetApp acquired Instaclustr, a solution for managing open source database and streaming technologies. The company recognizes the growing importance of open source for enterprises. \u201cWe're paying attention to trends for cloud applications,\u201d Williams said, \u201cand we're growing the portfolio to address the needs that are top of mind for those customers.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Check out the entire episode to learn more about CloudOps.</p>\n",
