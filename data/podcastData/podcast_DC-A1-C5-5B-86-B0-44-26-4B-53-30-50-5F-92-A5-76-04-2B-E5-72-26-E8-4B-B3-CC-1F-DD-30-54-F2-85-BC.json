    "Description": "<p>This week Jonathan Bennett and Jeff Massie talk with <a href= \"https://jpmens.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JP Mens</a> about <a href=\"https://owntracks.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Owntracks</a>, the collection of programs that lets you take back control of your own location data. It's built around the simple idea of taking position data from a mobile phone or other data source, sending it over MQTT to a central server, and logging that data to a simple data store.</p> <p>From there, you can share it as trips, mark points of interest, play back your movement in a web browser, and more. And because it's just JSON inside MQTT, it's pretty trivial to make a connector to interface with other projects, like Home Assistant.</p> <p>You can\u00a0<a href= \"https://discord.gg/w2RknXkJ7U?event=1192188220927119420\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">join the conversation in the Hackaday Discord</a>, where the show records live each week, as well as getting the full story and show links from <a href= \"https://Hackaday.com/floss\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Hackaday</a>.</p> <p>Theme music: \"Newer Wave\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p> <p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>",
