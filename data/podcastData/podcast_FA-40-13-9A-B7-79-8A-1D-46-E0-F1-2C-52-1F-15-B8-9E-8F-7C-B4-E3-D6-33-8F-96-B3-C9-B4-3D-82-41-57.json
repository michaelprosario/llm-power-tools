    "Description": "<p>Professor Kenneth Stanley is currently a research science manager at OpenAI in San Fransisco. We've Been dreaming about getting Kenneth on the show since the very begininning of Machine Learning Street Talk. Some of you might recall that our first ever show was on the enhanced POET paper, of course Kenneth had his hands all over it. He's been cited over 16000 times, his most popular paper with over 3K citations was the NEAT algorithm. His interests are neuroevolution, open-endedness, NNs, artificial life, and AI. He invented the concept of novelty search with no clearly defined objective. His key idea is that there is a tyranny of objectives prevailing in every aspect of our lives, society and indeed our algorithms. Crucially, these objectives produce convergent behaviour and thinking and distract us from discovering stepping stones which will lead to greatness. He thinks that this monotonic objective obsession, this idea that we need to continue to improve benchmarks every year is dangerous. He wrote about this in detail in his recent book \"greatness can not be planned\" which will be the main topic of discussion in the show. We also cover his ideas on open endedness in machine learning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:00 Intro to Kenneth&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:01:16 Show structure disclaimer&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:04:16 Passionate discussion&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:06:26 WHy greatness cant be planned and the tyranny of objectives&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:14:40 Chinese Finger Trap &nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:16:28 Perverse Incentives and feedback loops&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:18:17 Deception&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:23:29 Maze example&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:24:44 How can we define curiosity or interestingness&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:26:59 Open endedness&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:33:01 ICML 2019 and Yannic, POET, first MSLST&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:36:17 evolutionary algorithms++&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:43:18 POET, the first MLST &nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:45:39 A lesson to GOFAI people&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:48:46 Machine Learning -- the great stagnation&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:54:34 Actual scientific successes are usually luck, and against the odds -- Biontech&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:56:21 Picbreeder and NEAT&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:10:47 How Tim applies these ideas to his life and why he runs MLST&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:14:58 Keith Skit about UCF&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:15:13 Main show kick off&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:18:02 Why does Kenneth value serindipitous exploration so much&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:24:10 Scientific support for Keneths ideas in normal life&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:27:12 We should drop objectives to achieve them.
