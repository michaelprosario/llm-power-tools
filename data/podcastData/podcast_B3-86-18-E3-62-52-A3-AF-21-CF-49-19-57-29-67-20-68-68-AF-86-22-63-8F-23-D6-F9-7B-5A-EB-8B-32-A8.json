    "Description": "<p>Christmas time with COVID! Richard invites Mary Jo Foley on the show to celebrate a bit of Christmas and reflect on what a crazy year 2020 has been. Mary Jo talks about the early days of the pandemic when the tech companies sent everyone home and the challenge of keeping the internet and cloud providers working while the loads went up... it may have been a near thing! The conversation ultimately turns to gratitude for friends, family, and a great career in this industry. All the best to you and yours!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/\">All About Microsoft</a></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
