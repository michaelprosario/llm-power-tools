    "Description": "<p>Please support us https://www.patreon.com/mlst </p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/MLStreetTalk</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Lance Da Costa aims to advance our understanding of intelligent systems by modelling cognitive systems and improving artificial systems.</p>\n<p>He&#39;s a PhD candidate with Greg Pavliotis and Karl Friston jointly at Imperial College London and UCL, and a student in the Mathematics of Random Systems CDT run by Imperial College London and the University of Oxford. He completed an MRes in Brain Sciences at UCL with Karl Friston and Biswa Sengupta, an MASt in Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge with Oscar Randal-Williams, and a BSc in Mathematics at EPFL and the University of Toronto. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<p>Lance did pure math originally but became interested in the brain and AI. He started working with Karl Friston on the free energy principle, which claims all intelligent agents minimize free energy for perception, action, and decision-making. Lance has worked to provide mathematical foundations and proofs for why the free energy principle is true, starting from basic assumptions about agents interacting with their environment. This aims to justify the principle from first physics principles. Dr. Scarfe and Da Costa discuss different approaches to AI - the free energy/active inference approach focused on mimicking human intelligence vs approaches focused on maximizing capability like deep reinforcement learning. Lance argues active inference provides advantages for explainability and safety compared to black box AI systems. It provides a simple, sparse description of intelligence based on a generative model and free energy minimization. They discuss the need for structured learning and acquiring core knowledge to achieve more human-like intelligence. Lance highlights work from Josh Tenenbaum&#39;s lab that shows similar learning trajectories to humans in a simple Atari-like environment.</p>\n<p>Incorporating core knowledge constraints the space of possible generative models the agent can use to represent the world, making learning more sample efficient. Lance argues active inference agents with core knowledge can match human learning capabilities.</p>\n<p>They discuss how to make generative models interpretable, such as through factor graphs. The goal is to be able to understand the representations and message passing in the model that leads to decisions.</p>\n<p>In summary, Lance argues active inference provides a principled approach to AI with advantages for explainability, safety, and human-like learning. Combining it with core knowledge and structural learning aims to achieve more human-like artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>https://www.lancelotdacosta.com/</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/lancelotdacosta</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Interviewer: Dr. Tim Scarfe</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC</p>\n<p>00:00:00 - Start</p>\n<p>00:09:27 - Intelligence</p>\n<p>00:12:37 - Priors / structure learning</p>\n<p>00:17:21 - Core knowledge</p>\n<p>00:29:05 - Intelligence is specialised</p>\n<p>00:33:21 - The magic of agents</p>\n<p>00:39:30 - Intelligibility of structure learning</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>#artificialintelligence #activeinference</p>\n",
