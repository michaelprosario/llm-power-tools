    "Description": "<p>What does high availability look like in 2023? Richard chats with Allan Hirt about his work with high-availability solutions today - not just on-premises but also in the cloud. Allan talks about the frustration folks had with moving workloads in the cloud during the pandemic panic, lift-and-shifting workloads focusing on getting things working quickly rather than cost-effectively. The results can be costly, to the point where some folks considering moving back off the cloud again - but does that make sense? Allan talks about creating high availability efficiently wherever you want to run your workloads!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/availability-group-overview?view=azuresql?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Always On on SQL Server with Azure VMs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2022\">SQL Server 2022</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Azure Regions and Availability Zones</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scom/welcome?view=sc-om-2022?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Operations Manager</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 11, 2023</p>\n",
