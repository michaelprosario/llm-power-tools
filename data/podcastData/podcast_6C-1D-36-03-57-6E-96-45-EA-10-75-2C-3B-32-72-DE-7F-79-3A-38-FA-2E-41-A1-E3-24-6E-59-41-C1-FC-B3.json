    "Description": "<p>Two college-era friends set out to change the face of shaving\u2014and in the process, took on one of the biggest companies in the world. In 2011, Andy Katz-Mayfield and Jeff Raider realized they shared a common frustration with an everyday purchase: razors. Locked behind counters like diamond bracelets, they were inconvenient to buy and expensive to replace, with branding that seemed more suited to James Bond than a regular guy.&nbsp;So Andy and Jeff took on the Goliath of the shaving industry, Gillette\u2014and its parent company, P&amp;G\u2014to launch a direct-to-consumer&nbsp;razor company with a friendly name.&nbsp;As a co-founder of Warby Parker, Jeff had some experience with D-to-C, but nothing prepared either founder for the rigors of razor research, and the culture shock of partnering with a factory in a remote part of Germany. After weathering a failed merger, Harry\u2019s Inc. has grown into a force in the shaving industry both online and in-store, and has begun expanding into other household products.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Liz Metzger, with music by Ramtin Arablouei</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Katherine Sypher.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter</em></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em></a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
