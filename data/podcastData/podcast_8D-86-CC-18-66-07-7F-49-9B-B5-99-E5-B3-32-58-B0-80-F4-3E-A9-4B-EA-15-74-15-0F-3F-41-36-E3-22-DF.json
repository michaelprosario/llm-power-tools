    "Description": "<p>With companies taking a long look at developer experience, it\u2019s time to turn that attention on the humble pull request. The folks at <a href=\"https://linearb.io/\">LinearB</a> took a look at a million PRs \u2014 four million review cycles involving around 25,000 developers \u2014 and found that it takes about five days to get through a review and merge the code. CI/CD has done wonders getting deployments down to a day or less; maybe it\u2019s time for continuous merge next.\u00a0</p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we chat with COO Dan Lines and CEO Ori Keren, co-founders of LinearB, about why PRs are the chokepoint in the software development lifecycle, uncovering and automating the hidden rules of review requests, and their free tool, gitStream, that\u2019ll find the right reviewer for your PR right now.\u00a0</p><p>Episode notes:\u00a0</p><p>So why do reviews take so long? Context switches, team leads who review everything, and the <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bystander-effect\">bystander effect</a> are top contenders.</p><p>Dan and Ori hope their gitStream tool can reduce the time PRs take by automating a lot of the hidden rules for reviews.
