    "Description": "<p>Despite our hope for the power of robotics, the technology is still far from mainstream. That\u2019s because the amount of effort needed to get hardware to do useful things at scale is\u2026well\u2026hard.</p><p>When Eliot started <a href=\"https://www.viam.com/\">Viam</a>, his goal was to address this challenge by creating software that supports a range of hardware builds right out of the box. As the company explains - \u201cwe\u2019re addressing these issues by building a novel robotics platform that relies on standardized building blocks rather than custom code to create, configure and control robots intuitively and quickly. We\u2019re empowering engineers \u2013 aspiring and experienced \u2013 across industries to solve complicated automation problems with our innovative software tools.\u201d The company announced the opening of its public beta earlier this week.</p><p>While Eliot elaborates on his vision for Viam, Ben reflects on his time covering drones for The Verge and working on robotics at DJI.</p><p>Inquisitive badge winner, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1034102/neeta\">Neeta</a>, gets props for asking well-received questions on 30 separate days.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benpopper\">Ben </a>and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliothorowitz\">Eliot </a>on Twitter.</p>\n",
