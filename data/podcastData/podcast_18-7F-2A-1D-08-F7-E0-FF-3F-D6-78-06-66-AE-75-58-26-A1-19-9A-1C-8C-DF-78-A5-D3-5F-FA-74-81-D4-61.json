    "Description": "<p>Windows 11 Ships! So now what? Richard chats with Mary Jo Foley about her thoughts around the release of Windows 11. Mary Jo talks about how quiet the conversation has been around Windows 11, other than a few bits of outrage like the TPM requirements - which, as it turns out, aren't actually required. Is there a reason to move to Windows 11? Most IT folks seem happy to wait for further updates - there's nothing wrong with Windows 10. Maybe operating system releases just aren't as exciting as they used to be?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11\">Upgrading to Windows 11</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly\">Windows Weekly</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/\">All About Microsoft</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 22, 2021</p>\n",
