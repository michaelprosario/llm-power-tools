    "Description": "<p>How do you manage your CI/CD pipeline resources? Richard chats with Eliza Tarasila about Managed DevOps Pools in Azure DevOps. Eliza tells the story of discovering that teams were using Azure DevOps internally at Microsoft but would need to build their tooling to stand up the resources for testing and deployment. Managed DevOps Pools became the standard way to specify resources like virtual machines and assign them to projects so that they would start up automatically. The resources in the pool can be custom resources in Azure or even on-premises servers! And, more importantly, you don't need to care and feed for the infrastructure used in the pipelines, Azure DevOps will do it for you.</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops\">Azure DevOps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Create and Manage Pools</a></li><li><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/engineering-at-microsoft/managed-devops-pools-the-origin-story/\">Managed DevOps Pool Origin Story</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/\">Azure DevOps Pricing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-machines/spot\">Azure Spot Virtual Machines</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/managed-devops-pools?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Managed DevOps Pools Documentation</a></li></ul><p>Recorded January 6, 2025</p>\n",
