    "Description": "<p>Artificial Intelligence sounds fantastic and far off, but it underlies so many things we do today. Today I talk with Jason Thacker, author of <a href= \"https://jasonthacker.com/2019/07/22/weeklytech-4-the-age-of-ai/\">The Age of AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity</a> about AI and ethics. He tries to explain what it is, what it does, and why we should be concerned about it as we look at our future. With up to 30% of our jobs being displaced by AI in the next ten years, we should be considering what it is and how we should be using it.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e684\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e684</a>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Sponsor: Welcome TGR Foundation and Discovery Education as a sponsor to my podcast.
