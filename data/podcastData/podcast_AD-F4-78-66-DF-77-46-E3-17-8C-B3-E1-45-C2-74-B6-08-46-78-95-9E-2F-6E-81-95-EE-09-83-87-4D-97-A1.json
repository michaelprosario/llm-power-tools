    "Description": "<p>What else can Teams do? Richard chats with Christina Wheeler about going beyond the default features of Teams, turning it into the hub of work that it can be. Christina talks about the various plugins available for Teams available from third-party companies, as well as the kinds of add-ins you can build yourself. The conversation focuses on app templates as useful tools unto themselves, like the request-a-team template that lets you control the creation of Teams. But since it is an open-source project, you can customize it, or use it as a starting point for something more extensive. With excellent security and governance features, you can extend Teams to help your users have one place to look for all their work!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates\">App Templates for Microsoft Teams</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=teams_int_setup_configure_in_salesforce.htm\">Teams Integration with Salesforce</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-teams-in-modern-portal\">Teams Admin Center</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/ms-600\">MS-600: Building Applications and Solutions with Microsoft 365 Core Services</a></li><li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vsteamstemplate\">Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.qnamaker.ai/\">QnA Maker</a></li></ul>\n",
