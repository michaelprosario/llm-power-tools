    "Description": "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have seen a surge in adoption and advances for IT applications, especially for database management, CI/CD support and other functionalities. Robotics, meanwhile, is largely relegated to factory-floor automation. In this The New Stack Makers podcast, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieterabbeel/\">Pieter Abbeel</a>, co-founder, president, chief scientist at <a href=\"https://covariant.ai/\">covariant.ai</a>, a supplier of \u201cuniversal AI\u201d for robotics, discusses why and how the potential of robotics can evolve beyond just serving as pre-programmed devices thanks to advances in IT. Abbeel also draws on his background to offer his perspective, as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a podcast host at <a href=\"https://www.therobotbrains.ai/\">The Robot Brains Podcast</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a>, founder and publisher of The New Stack, hosted this podcast.</p>\n",
