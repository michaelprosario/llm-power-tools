    "Description": "\n        <p>Kona Ice founder Tony Lamb had a knack for sales since he was a teenager - a skill that served him well when he decided to sell Hawaiian-style shaved ice in Kentucky, where people had barely heard of it. After thirteen successful years as a vacuum cleaner salesman, Tony launched his first shaved ice truck in 2007. Fueled by a bad experience buying freezer-burned popsicles off a battered ice cream truck, he built a custom-made vehicle with a tropical vibe and a built-in \u201cFlavorwave\u201d that let customers dispense their own syrups. Two decades after surrendering his salesman\u2019s suit for a Hawaiian shirt, Tony has grown Kona Ice into a sprawling franchise with 1500 trucks across North America.</p><p>This episode was produced by Casey Herman with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Katherine Sypher.</p><p>Our engineers were Ko Takasugi-Czernowin and Robert Rodriguez.</p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
