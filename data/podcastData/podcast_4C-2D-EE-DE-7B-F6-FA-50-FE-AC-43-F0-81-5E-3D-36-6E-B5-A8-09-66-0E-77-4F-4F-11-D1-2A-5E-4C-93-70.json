    "Description": "<p>ByConity is an open source project that emerged from ByteDance's use of Clickhouse, an open-source database system, to address their growing data volume. ByConity focuses on enhancing the separation of compute and storage, improving multitenancy support, and optimizing query performance in cloud-native environments.</p><p>ByteDance's Vini Jaiswal, a principle developer advocate at the parent company of TikTok, highlights the power of open source in fostering innovation and collaboration. She shares her personal experience of leveraging open source to solve problems quickly and efficiently. She emphasizes the importance of getting involved in open source, even for those who might be hesitant, and suggests starting by identifying a pain point and making small contributions.</p><p>ByConity's architecture, which separates compute and storage, offers benefits like preventing data lake corruption, read and write separation, elasticity, and scalability. Jaiswal also mentions her previous experience with open source during her time at CitiBank, where she realized how open source accelerated digital transformations.</p><p>Throughout the conversation, Jaiswal underscores the strength of open source communities in collectively addressing challenges. She encourages listeners to embrace open source and start contributing, emphasizing how even small contributions can lead to significant impacts over time.</p><p>The episode also delves into Jaiswal's involvement with other open source projects, such as PyTorch, and explores the intersection of open source and generative AI.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about open source and cloud native environments:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/what-is-cloud-native-and-why-does-it-matter/\">What Is 'Cloud Native' (and Why Does It Matter)?</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/\">Cloud Native Ecosystem News and Resources</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-an-open-source-community/\">How to Build an Open Source Community</a></p>\n",
