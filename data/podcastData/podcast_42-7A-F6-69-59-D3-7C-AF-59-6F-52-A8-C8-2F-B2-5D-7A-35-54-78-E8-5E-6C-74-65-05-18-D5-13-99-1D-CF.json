Ryan earned a BS in computer science & engineering from UCLA, and an MS in computer science from Stanford University.</p><blockquote><p>\"There are a few things that I have come to have strong opinions about... One is, teams should own their own domains, services and data. You got to own full-stack your domain. You want to minimize coordination between teams and dependencies on teams. And then something that gets often overlooked as you scale is... aligning the organization with the architecture. The organization's growing, the architecture is evolving, but you have to consciously align those two things if you want to maintain a highly functioning engineering team as you grow...\u201d</p><p>- Ryan King</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cchio/\"><strong>CLARENCE CHIO</strong></a></h2><p>Clarence Chio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cchio\">(@cchio)</a> is the co-founder and CTO at Unit21, a Google-funded startup in San Francisco building tools to fight fraud, money laundering, and online abuse.
