    "Description": "<p>Dr. Eray Ozkural is an AGI researcher from Turkey, he is the founder of Celestial Intellect Cybernetics. Eray is extremely critical of Max Tegmark, Nick Bostrom and MIRI founder Elizier Yodokovsky and their views on AI safety. Eray thinks that these views represent a form of neoludditism and they are capturing valuable research budgets with doomsday fear-mongering and effectively want to prevent AI from being developed by those they don't agree with. Eray is also sceptical of the intelligence explosion hypothesis and the argument from simulation.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Panel -- Dr. Keith Duggar, Dr. Tim Scarfe, Yannic Kilcher</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:00 Show teaser intro with added nuggets and commentary</p>\n<p>00:48:39 Main Show Introduction&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:53:14 Doomsaying to Control &nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:56:39 Fear the Basilisk! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:08:00 Intelligence Explosion Ethics &nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:09:45 Fear the Automous Drone! ... or spam &nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:11:25 Infinity Point Hypothesis &nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:15:26 Meat Level Intelligence&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:21:25 Defining Intelligence ...
