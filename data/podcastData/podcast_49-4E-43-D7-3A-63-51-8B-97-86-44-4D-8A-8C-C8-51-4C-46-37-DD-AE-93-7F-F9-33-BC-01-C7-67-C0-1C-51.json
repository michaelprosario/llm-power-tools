    "Description": " Reading stamina matters. Prior to the pandemic, nearly <a href= \"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/\">two-thirds of students</a> in the US were not at or above grade reading level for grade 4,8, and 12 (NAEP). If that isn't bad enough, <a href= \"http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs46-more-than-half-children-not-learning-en-2017.pdf\"> UNESCO</a> found that more than half of children and adolescents were not even learning worldwide. Furthermore, in September 2020, <a href= \"https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/covid-19/\">UNICEF reported</a> that 1 billion children worldwide aren't learning at all. With these big picture stats and stories coming from the classroom, teachers need advice on helping students develop reading stamina. In episode 769 and this blog post, we're going to dig into reading stamina, why it is important, and practical ways we can help our students progress with reading stamina. My goal is to create a useful resource that teachers everywhere can use to get started with building reading stamina.
