    "Description": "<p>2023 has been a challenging year for sysadmins so far - how do we do more with less? Richard talks to Sonia Cuff about the current climate for IT in organizations and how we can still be successful. It's not all about building new things but being more efficient. Sonia talks about measuring more precisely - making sure that the expenses that IT has get assigned to revenue centers so that you're not cutting indiscriminately but associating costs with income - then those costs will more naturally adjust. The conversation also dives into new technologies that can be explored on the basis that they can improve efficiency - like large language models and their associated products. There's still a lot to do, but with a slightly different focus!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.realitybasedleadership.com/\">Reality-Based Leadership</a></li><li><a href=\"https://runasradio.com/Shows/Show/882\">Azure Sticker Shock</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.finops.org/\">FinOps Foundation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/\">M365 Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://iview.abc.net.au/show/old-people-s-home-for-4-year-olds\">Old People's Home From 4 Years Olds</a></li></ul><p>Recorded July 27, 2023</p>\n",
