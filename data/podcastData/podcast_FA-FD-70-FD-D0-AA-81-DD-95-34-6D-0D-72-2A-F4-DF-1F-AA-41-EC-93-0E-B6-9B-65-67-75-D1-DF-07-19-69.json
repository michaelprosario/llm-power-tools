That's what everybody else understands. They're not going to understand, 'Oh, we need to migrate the data center to the cloud.' They're not going to understand that, 'Hey, these are all the technical reasons why a forklift could be very complicated.' You have to put it in terms that the business is going to understand. That is going to be the art, and along the way, I think if you use that framework, it helps your own teams understand why their work is relevant to the business.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Han Yuan \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Join us at ELC Annual 2023!</h2><p>ELC Annual is our flagship conference for engineering leaders.

Sapiens focuses on key processes that shaped humankind and the world around it, such as the advent of agriculture, the creation of money, the spread of religion and the rise of the nation-state. Unlike other books of its kind, Sapiens takes a multi-disciplinary approach that bridges the gaps between history, biology, philosophy and economics in a way never done before. Furthermore, taking both the macro and the micro view, Sapiens conveys not only what happened and why, but also how it felt for individuals.</li></ul><h3><strong>This episode wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the help of our incredible production team:</strong></h3><p>Patrick Gallagher - Producer & Co-Host</p><p>Jerry Li - Co-Host</p><p>Noah Olberding - Associate Producer, Audio & Video Editor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/</a></p><p>Dan Overheim - Audio Engineer, Dan\u2019s also an avid 3D printer - <a href=\"https://www.bnd3d.com/\">https://www.bnd3d.com/</a></p><p>Ellie Coggins Angus - Copywriter, Check out her other work at <a href=\"https://elliecoggins.com/about/\">https://elliecoggins.com/about/</a></p>\n",
