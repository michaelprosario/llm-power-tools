    "Description": "<p>Barb Gilman (known as @barbinnebraska) has a classroom rich with a love of reading. Today she talks about strategies any teacher can use to help kids love reading. She starts with a sign posting what she's reading now! I've heard other educators (including my friend Todd Nesloney) who have teachers in their schools post what they are reading.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e403\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e403</a></p> <p>Join Augmented Reality Classroom enthusiasts as they talk about the pedagogies of teaching with AR.
