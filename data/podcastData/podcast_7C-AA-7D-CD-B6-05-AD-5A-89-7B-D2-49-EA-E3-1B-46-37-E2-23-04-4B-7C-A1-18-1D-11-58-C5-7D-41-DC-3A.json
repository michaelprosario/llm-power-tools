    "SourceUrl": "https://www.hanselminutes.com/",
    "Description": "<p>Vibe Coding has folks talking and \"vibing entire applications.\" But is it valid? Should one use AI agents to create apps that go directly into production, or is it just appropriate for prototyping? Scott talks to James Montemagno who recently vibed a 17,000 line application and only wrote 20 bespoke lines himself. Is this the future of programming or did James get lucky? Scott takes the sceptical view in this spicy episode.</p>\n",
