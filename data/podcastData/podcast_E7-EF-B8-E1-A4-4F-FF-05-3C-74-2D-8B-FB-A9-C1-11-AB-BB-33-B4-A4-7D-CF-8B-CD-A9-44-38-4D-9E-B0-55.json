    "Description": "<p>I was in a car accident back in November 2023 and had to seek medical treatment for whiplash. I was referred to Pavlik Center for Health and Wellness and met Dr. Jae and also Dr. Dan Jr. (most of the docs go by Dr. and their first name).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dr. Dan is an expert in his field of chiropractic care. His 5 words that describe him are \u201cLaid Back, Born to Heal.\u201d \u00a0On this episode we talked about the use of laser and light therapy, maybe x-ray vision that allows a person to be scanned with x-ray glasses rather than an MRI or X-Ray machine. He also shared the most common misconceptions about chiropractic care and dispels those fears with truth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tune in to hear more about his thoughts of what Healthy Care looks like now and what treatment might look like in 2030. \u00a0His thought leader is his father, Dr. Dan Pavlik, Sr., who founded Pavlik Center who encouraged him during his career journey to Think Outside the Box and helped him develop a mindset of providing the best care possible to his patients.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Intern Whisperer Podcast is brought to you by Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
