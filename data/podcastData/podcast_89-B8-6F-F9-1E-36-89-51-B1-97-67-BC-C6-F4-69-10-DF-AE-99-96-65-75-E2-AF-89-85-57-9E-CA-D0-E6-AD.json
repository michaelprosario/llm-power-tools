    "Description": "<p>Surprise can increase learning and change the lives of our students in positive ways. Today\u2019s guest researcher, Dr. Michael Rousell, studies the neuroscience of surprise and has some interesting points for educators and presenters.\u00a0</p> <p>The Johns Hopkins\u2019 article,\u00a0 <a href= \"https://www.medicaldaily.com/element-surprise-helps-babies-learn-significantly-better-327844#:~:text=The%20element%20of%20surprise%20provides,the%20ramp%20as%20they%20expected.\"> The Element of Surprise Helps Babies Learn Significantly Better</a>, points to a phenomenon that impacts all ages. For example, if you\u2019ve played peekaboo with a baby, you know the surprise is what makes them laugh. Interestingly, researchers found that once babies saw something that surprised them, their engagement with the object peaked their learning behavior which improved significantly compared to a baby who was not surprised.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>So they found that babies who were shown surprising events were able to learn faster and more efficiently afterward than those who were not.</p> <p>Today we will discuss how surprise applies to learning.</p> <p>Show Notes and Transcript: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e774\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e774</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Sponsor: Today\u2019s sponsor is <a href= \"https://legacy.smarttech.com/en/lumio?utm_source=cool-cat-teacher&utm_medium=podcast&utm_content=lumio&utm_campaign=cool-cat-teacher-q1-2022\"> Lum.io</a>, an award-winning digital learning tool that will transform your lessons into active, collaborative learning experiences If you\u2019re looking for a collaborative learning tool to make it easy to level up your lesson materials you already have with assessments, game-based activities, collaborative spaces and lots more all in one place, Lumio is the perfect choice for you.
