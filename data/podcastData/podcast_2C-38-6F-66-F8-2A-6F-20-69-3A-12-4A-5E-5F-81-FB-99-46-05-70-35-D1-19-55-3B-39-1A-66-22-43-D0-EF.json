    "Description": "<p>Is everything old new again? Scott chats with Eric Newcomer about the recurring patterns he's seen as the CTO of WSO2 and across his career as a technologist building large systems. We'll talk about complexity vs. simplicity, abstraction vs. control, and one of Eric's favorite topics - transactions and eventual consistency. Eric will also explain the value of the new Ballerina open-source programming language for the cloud that makes it easier to use, combine, and create network services, and how it is used in Choreo - a new integration Platform as a Service for API developers.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3llrcsD\" target=\"_blank\">Choreo</a></li><li><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3k8S3cj\" target=\"_blank\">WSO2</a></li></ul>\n",
