    "Description": "Technical interviews are the worst. They\u2019re hard, they\u2019re scary, and they often feel like they\u2019re designed to make you feel stupid. But no worries! We\u2019re here to help. We take a behind-the-scenes look at the interview process at two very prestigious companies, Etsy and the New York Times. Developers La Vesha Parker and Tiffany Peon break down each part of the interview process, giving you examples and explanations of exactly what they\u2019re looking for, and share their own stories of how they got their roles. We also have a second edition of our Coding Corner where we share more interview tips and dissect how to solve a popular interview question, FizzBuzz. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
