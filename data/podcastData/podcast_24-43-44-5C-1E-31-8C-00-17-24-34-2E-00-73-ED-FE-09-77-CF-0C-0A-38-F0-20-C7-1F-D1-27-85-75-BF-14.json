    "Description": "Self-taught developer Kinsey Ann Durham didn't stop at learning to code. In two years, she's spoken at tech conferences around the world, started an organization in Kenya to help women entrepreneurs (and of course wrote the software it runs on), and organizes events focused on women in tech in her town in Colorado. We talk about what it was like to give her first tech talk, how to use your coding skills for social good causes, and how she handled someone telling her that she should be a secretary instead. Glad she didn't listen. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie! (sponsor)  RailsBridge Women Who Code Kubmo CodeTriage Thoughtbot Apprenticeship Codeland Conf Codeland 2019 ",
