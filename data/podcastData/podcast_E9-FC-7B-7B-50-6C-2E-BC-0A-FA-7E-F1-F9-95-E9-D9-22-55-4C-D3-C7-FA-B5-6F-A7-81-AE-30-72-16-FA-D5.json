    "Description": "\n        <p>If you think a great idea is all it takes to be a successful entrepreneur, best-selling author and Princeton professor Derek Lidow says you might want to think twice about starting your own business. However, if you follow his advice and start by honestly determining <em>why</em>you want to be an entrepreneur, your chances of success dramatically increase. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to look to some of the all-time greats for inspiration. Tune in as Derek shares what Sam Walton and Walt Disney did right (and wrong), as well as ways to win in your own endeavors. Also joining us is Ramsey Solutions Executive Vice President Brian Williams to share his thoughts on leading teams well. Trust us, after heading up four different teams in three years, he has a wealth of insight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.com/app/form/form-leadergrowth1\">Leadership Growth Assessment</a>\u00a0from EntreLeadership</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.infusionsoft.com/resources/small-business-office-automation-guide\"> Small Business Office Automation Guide</a>\u00a0from Infusionsoft</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
