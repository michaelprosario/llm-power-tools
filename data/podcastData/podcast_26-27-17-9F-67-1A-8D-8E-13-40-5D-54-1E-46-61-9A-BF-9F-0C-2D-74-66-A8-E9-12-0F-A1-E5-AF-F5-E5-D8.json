    "Description": "<p>Integrated communication is everywhere! While at Build in Seattle, Richard talked with Bob Serr, the VP of Azure Communication Services (ACS) at Microsoft. Bob discusses how ACS provides tooling to integrate voice, text, and video into any application through Azure. This leads to a broader conversation about the power of deeper communication, especially for difficult discussions like tech support. Can adding video make it easier to diagnose a problem? And what is the role of the new large language model technologies coming from OpenAI in providing automated communications? There are a lot of possibilities available today!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/communication-services/\">Azure Communication Services</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service\">Azure OpenAI Service</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 25, 2023</p>\n",
