    "Description": "<p>What are some creative ways to design assignments that prevent AI cheating? Professor Laurel Aguilar-Kirchhoff is working to adjust her assignments for the English Language Learners teachers. She changed their midterm essay to a storyboard.\u00a0</p> <p>We also talked about how she has changed discussion forum posts, which seem to be heavily written via AI. She likes the new method much better.</p> <p>Many educators ask how effective AI detectors are in identifying AI-generated content. They aren't. AI detectors don't work. However, there are some signs that we discuss in this podcast that we've noticed when AI is being used. However, as we educators grapple with AI, we have to stop trying to find detectors (none of which work) and start working towards meaningful projects and sharing what works. I hope this show helps start the conversation with you at your school.</p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e856\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e856</a>\u00a0</p>",
