    "Description": "<p>In this episode of Machine Learning Street Talk, Tim Scarfe, Yannic Kilcher and Connor Shorten interviewed Harri Valpola, CEO and Founder of Curious AI. We continued our discussion of System 1 and System 2 thinking in Deep Learning, as well as miscellaneous topics around Model-based Reinforcement Learning. Dr. Valpola describes some of the challenges of modelling industrial control processes such as water sewage filters and paper mills with the use of model-based RL. Dr. Valpola and his collaborators recently published \u201cRegularizing Trajectory Optimization with Denoising Autoencoders\u201d that addresses some of the concerns of planning algorithms that exploit inaccuracies in their world models!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:00 Intro to Harri and Curious AI System1/System 2</p>\n<p>00:04:50 Background on model-based RL challenges from Tim</p>\n<p>00:06:26 Other interesting research papers on model-based RL from Connor</p>\n<p>00:08:36 Intro to Curious AI recent NeurIPS paper on model-based RL and denoising autoencoders from Yannic</p>\n<p>00:21:00 Main show kick off, system 1/2</p>\n<p>00:31:50 Where does the simulator come from?</p>\n<p>00:33:59 Evolutionary priors</p>\n<p>00:37:17 Consciousness</p>\n<p>00:40:37 How does one build a company like Curious AI?</p>\n<p>00:46:42 Deep Q Networks</p>\n<p>00:49:04 Planning and Model based RL</p>\n<p>00:53:04 Learning good representations</p>\n<p>00:55:55 Typical problem Curious AI might solve in industry</p>\n<p>01:00:56 Exploration</p>\n<p>01:08:00 Their paper - regularizing trajectory optimization with denoising</p>\n<p>01:13:47 What is Epistemic uncertainty</p>\n<p>01:16:44 How would Curious develop these models</p>\n<p>01:18:00 Explainability and simulations</p>\n<p>01:22:33 How system 2 works in humans</p>\n<p>01:26:11 Planning</p>\n<p>01:27:04 Advice for starting an AI company</p>\n<p>01:31:31 Real world implementation of planning models</p>\n<p>01:33:49 Publishing research and openness</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We really hope you enjoy this episode, please subscribe!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Regularizing Trajectory Optimization with Denoising Autoencoders: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8552-regularizing-trajectory-optimization-with-denoising-autoencoders.pdf</p>\n<p>Pulp, Paper &amp; Packaging: A Future Transformed through Deep Learning: https://thecuriousaicompany.com/pulp-paper-packaging-a-future-transformed-through-deep-learning/</p>\n<p>Curious AI: https://thecuriousaicompany.com/</p>\n<p>Harri Valpola Publications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1uT7-84AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao</p>\n<p>Some interesting papers around Model-Based RL:</p>\n<p>GameGAN: https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Nvidia_GameGAN_Research.pdf</p>\n<p>Plan2Explore: https://ramanans1.github.io/plan2explore/</p>\n<p>World Models: https://worldmodels.github.io/</p>\n<p>MuZero: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265.pdf</p>\n<p>PlaNet: A Deep Planning Network for RL: https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-planet-deep-planning.html</p>\n<p>Dreamer: Scalable RL using World Models: https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/introducing-dreamer-scalable.html</p>\n<p>Model Based RL for Atari: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00374.pdf</p>\n",
