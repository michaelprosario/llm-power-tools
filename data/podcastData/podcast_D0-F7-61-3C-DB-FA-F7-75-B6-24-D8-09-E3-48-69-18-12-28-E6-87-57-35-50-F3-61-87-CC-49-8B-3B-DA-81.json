    "Description": "<p>LOS ANGELES \u2014 When you\u2019re deploying a business-critical application to the cloud, it\u2019s nice to not need the \u201cwar room\u201d you\u2019ve assembled to troubleshoot Day 1 problems.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>When BOK Financial, a financial services company that\u2019s been moving apps to the cloud over the last three years, was launching its largest application on the cloud, its engineers supported it with a \u201cwar room type situation, monitoring everything\u201d according to BOK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewrau/\">Andrew Rau</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAfter the first day, the system just scaled like it was supposed to \u2026 and they're like, \u2018OK, I guess we don't need this anymore.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In this On the Road episode of The New Stack\u2019s Makers podcast, Rau, BOK\u2019s vice president and manager, cloud services, offered a case study about his organization\u2019s cloud journey over the past four years, and the role HashiCorp\u2019s Vault and Cloud Platform played in it.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Rau spoke to <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/hjoslyn\">Heather Joslyn</a>, features editor of The New Stack, about the challenges of moving a very traditional organization in a highly regulated industry to the cloud while maintaining tight security and resilience.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This episode of Makers, recorded in October at HashiConf in Los Angeles, was and sponsored by HashiCorp.</p><p><h2>Upskilling for \u2018Everything as Code\u2019</h2></p><p>In late 2019, Rau said, BOK Financial deployed one small application to the cloud, an initial step on its digital transformation journey. It\u2019s been building out its cloud infrastructure ever since, and soon ran into the limits of each cloud provider\u2019s native tooling.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere we struggled was we didn't want to deploy and manage our clouds in different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn't want our cloud engineers to know just one cloud provider, and their technology and their tech stack. So that's when we really started looking at how else can we do this. And that's when Terraform was a great option for us.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In 2020, BOK Financial began using HashCorp\u2019s open source Terraform to automate the creation of cloud infrastructure. \u201cWe made a conscious effort to really focus on automation,\u201d Rau said. \u201cWe didn't want to do things manually, which is really that traditional data center, how we've done things for decades.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In tandem with adopting Terraform, BOK Financial\u2019s teams began using GitOps processes for CI/CD. But doing \u201ceverything as code,\u201d as Rau put it, \u201crequired a lot of upskilling for some of our staff, because they've never done version control or automation capabilities. So in addition to learning Terraform, and these other cloud concepts, they had to learn all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The challenge, though, has been worth it: \u201cIt's really empowered us to move a lot faster, and give our application teams the ability to deploy at their pace, versus waiting on other teams.\u201d</p><p><h2>Seeking Automated Security</h2></p><p>It took about a year, Rau said, to get BOK Financial\u2019s developers comfortable using Terraform, largely because many were new to version control procedures and strategies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Because the company works in a highly regulated industry, handling customers\u2019 financial data, security is of utmost importance.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe had users credentials for our clouds, and we had them separated out based on the type of deployment that [developers] were doing,\u201d said Rau.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn't easy for us to rotate those credentials on a frequent basis. And so we really felt the need that we want to make these short, limited tokens, no more than an hour for that deployment. And so that's where we looked at Vault.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>HashiCorp\u2019s secrets storage and management tool proved an easy add-on with Terraform. \u201cThat's really given us the ability to have effectively no credentials \u2014 long-lived credentials \u2014\u00a0out there,\u201d Rau said. \u201cAnd secure our environment even more.\u201d And because BOK\u2019s teams don\u2019t want to manage Vault and its complexities themselves, it has opted for HashiCorp Cloud Platform to manage it.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For other organizations on a cloud native journey, Rau recommended taking time to do things right. \u201cWe went back to rework some things periodically, because we learned something too late,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Also, he advised, keep stakeholders in the loop: \u00a0\u201cYou need to stay in front of the communication with business partners, IT leaders, that it's going to take longer to set this up. But once you do, it's incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Check out the podcast to learn more about BOK Financial's cloud native transformation.</p>\n",
