    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>Eric was a build engineer at Apple for many years, then started a FeaturePeek which went through Y-combinator. He talks about what he learned from those experiences and how he'll be applying that knowledge to his new job at Netlify.</p><p>The teams combined forces to make the process of submitting and gathering feedback on deploy previews easier and more broadly accessible outside technical teams. As Cassidy explained:</p><p>\u201cBased on technology from FeaturePeek, Deploy Previews enables reviewers to comment, screen record, and annotate right from the actual preview link. No new tabs. No new tools. Everyone\u2019s feedback is recorded back in the GitHub pull request and can even extend to popular productivity tools such as <a href=\"http://clubhouse.io/\">Clubhouse.io</a>, Linear, and Trello.\u201d</p><p>This feature set is near and dear to Ben\u2019s heart. Now folks from marketing and design can offer feedback and be more tightly involved in the development process for new features, products, and websites. All without really learning Git!\u00a0</p><p>Also discussed this episode: weirdware, workflow automation, Jerry Garcia, compound bows, and the spread of Git and branch methodology to areas well outside software development.</p>\n",
