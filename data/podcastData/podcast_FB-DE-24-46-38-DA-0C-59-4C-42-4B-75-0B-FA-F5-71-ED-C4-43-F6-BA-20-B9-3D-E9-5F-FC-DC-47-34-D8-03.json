    "Description": "<p>At Google Cloud Next, Bobby Allen, Group Product Manager for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), emphasized GKE\u2019s foundational role in supporting AI platforms. While AI dominates current tech conversations, Allen highlighted that cloud-native infrastructure like Kubernetes is what enables AI workloads to function efficiently. GKE powers key Google services like Vertex AI and is trusted by organizations including DeepMind, gaming companies, and healthcare providers for AI model training and inference.\u00a0</p><p>Allen explained that GKE offers scalability, elasticity, and support for AI-specific hardware like GPUs and TPUs, making it ideal for modern workloads. He noted that Kubernetes was built with capabilities\u2014like high availability and secure orchestration\u2014that are now essential for AI deployment. Looking forward, GKE aims to evolve into a model router, allowing developers to access the right AI model based on function, not vendor, streamlining the development experience. Allen described GKE as offering maximum control with minimal technical debt, future-proofed by Google\u2019s continued investment in open source and scalable architecture.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about the latest insights with Google Cloud:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/google-kubernetes-engine-customized-for-faster-ai-work/\">Google Kubernetes Engine Customized for Faster AI Work</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/kubecon-europe-how-google-will-evolve-kubernetes-in-ai-era/ \">KubeCon Europe: How Google Will Evolve Kubernetes in the AI Era</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/apache-ray-finds-a-home-on-the-google-kubernetes-engine/ \">Apache Ray Finds a Home on the Google Kubernetes Engine</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
