    "Description": "<p>Schools spend time, resources, and focus on security. Now, that security is moving online. What was once relegated to the IT department is now everybody's business. In today's show, I share four security issues that are on my mind. First, video conferencing security.

Third, I talk about increasing awareness of social media manipulation by countries. Finally, I share what I think will be the next attempt to steal information from your students and teachers through spearphishing.</p> <p>See links to articles in the shownotes at <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e659\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e659</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Sponsor: See <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/10-awesome-courses-to-improve-your-online-classroom/\"> 10 Professional Development Courses to Improve Your Online Classroom</a> which I shared recently on my blog.
