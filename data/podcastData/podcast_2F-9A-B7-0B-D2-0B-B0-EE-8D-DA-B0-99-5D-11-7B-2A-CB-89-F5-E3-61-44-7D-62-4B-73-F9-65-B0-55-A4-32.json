    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Serial Entrepreneur, Khai Pham. You will learn why data science is an advantage in terms of mindset even to be an entrepreneur. You will hear about general artificial intelligence versus superintelligence, what are the differences and why you don't really need general artificial intelligence to get to superintelligence. You'll also learn how questions are more important than answers, and hence the reasoning engine versus a search engine. You'll hear about Khai's experience in becoming a founder of companies. You'll learn what the whole idea of reasoning is and why companies need to move from data-driven and machine learning-driven to reasoning-driven.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/277\">www.superdatascience.com/277</a></p>\n      ",
