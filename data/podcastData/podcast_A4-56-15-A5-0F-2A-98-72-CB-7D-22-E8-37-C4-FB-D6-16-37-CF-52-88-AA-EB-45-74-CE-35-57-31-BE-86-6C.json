    "Title": "Rendering Revolutions: Chaos founder Vlado Koylazov's Journey from V-Ray to Virtual Production",
    "SourceUrl": "https://cesium.com/open-metaverse-podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>This podcast episode features Vlado Koylazov, co-founder of Chaos and inventor of the widely-used V-Ray rendering software. Koylazov shares his journey in computer graphics, from his early fascination with the field to the development of V-Ray and the latest innovations at Chaos.</p><p>Koylazov recounts the early days of V-Ray development, highlighting key features that set it apart, such as being a pure ray tracer with physical lights and materials. He emphasizes the importance of user-focused design, which led to the inclusion of features like the Sun and Sky system and light portals, making V-Ray particularly successful in architectural visualization.</p><p>The conversation delves into the development of Chaos Vantage, a real-time ray tracing tool. Koylazov explains the challenges they faced in achieving real-time performance, including the need for advanced denoising techniques and careful feature selection. He highlights the significance of NVIDIA's DLSS technology in enabling upscaling, denoising, and anti-aliasing for improved performance.</p><p>Koylazov discusses Project Arena, Chaos's solution for virtual production on LED stages. He explains how this project leverages Vantage's capabilities to provide a streamlined workflow for users transitioning from traditional 3D content creation to virtual production environments.</p><p>The impact of AI on the industry is a significant topic of discussion. Koylazov shares insights on how AI is being used for image enhancement, scene generation, and material creation. He emphasizes the ongoing importance of 3D content for flexibility and directability, areas where current AI solutions may fall short.</p><p>The adoption of open standards like USD (Universal Scene Description) and MaterialX is addressed, with Koylazov explaining Chaos's involvement in these initiatives and their potential impact on workflow interoperability. He discusses the possibility of USD eventually replacing Chaos's proprietary VRScene format for internal communication between products.</p><p>Koylazov provides his perspective on the future of rendering technology, noting that while major breakthroughs may be less frequent, continuous refinements and workflow improvements remain crucial. He discusses the balance between different rendering solutions within Chaos, explaining why a single, all-encompassing renderer may not be practical given the diverse needs of different use cases.</p><p>Reflecting on his career, Koylazov highlights the implementation of the light cache in V-Ray as a significant achievement, which greatly enhanced its capabilities for architectural visualization. He also expresses pride in the enduring architecture of V-Ray, which has allowed for continuous development and collaboration over two decades.</p><p>The episode concludes with Koylazov acknowledging the collective effort behind Chaos's success, emphasizing the importance of teamwork in building successful products. He expresses gratitude for the contributions of his colleagues across various departments, from development to sales and marketing.</p><p>Throughout the conversation, Koylazov's passion for innovation and commitment to solving user challenges shines through, providing with valuable insights into the evolution of rendering technology and the future of computer graphics.</p>\n<p><p>Have any comments or questions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show Feedback@Buildingtheopenmetaverse.org</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Want more information?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Visit our website www.buildingtheopenmetaverse.org&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And make sure you follow us on Linkedin for all of our show updates&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/company/buildingtheopenmetaverse&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building the Open Metaverse is a podcast hosted by Patrick Cozzi (Cesium) and Marc Petit that invites a broad range of technical experts to share their insights on how the community is building the metaverse together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>#BuildingTheOpenMetaversePodcast #MetaversePodcast #Metaverse</p></p>",
