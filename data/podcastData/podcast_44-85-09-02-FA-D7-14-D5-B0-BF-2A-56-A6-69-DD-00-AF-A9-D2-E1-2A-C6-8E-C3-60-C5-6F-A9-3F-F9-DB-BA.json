    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Dennis Ivy, a software engineer and prolific freelancer. He dropped out of college at 18 and taught himself how to build websites. He started his first agency, built and sold products, and eventually started teaching his skills on YouTube.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- Growing up in an immigrant family of 13 kids - Dropping out of school and working construction before learning to code - Figuring out how to get web development clients through trial and error - Selling his codebase to his employer $61,000 and using it to fund his journey into teaching Python</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro?</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 10,443 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
