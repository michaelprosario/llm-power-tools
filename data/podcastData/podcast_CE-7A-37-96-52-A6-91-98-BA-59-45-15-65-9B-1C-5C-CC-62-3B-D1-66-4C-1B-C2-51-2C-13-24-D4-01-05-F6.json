    "Description": "<p>Chris Sells and Rory Blyth come over to Scott's house and proceed to record a horrible episode of Hanselminutes. Consider this a Holiday episode that is devoid of content. Run away, quickly, and we'll be back with great new shows, new topics and new guests in the new year. As for this episode, if you listen, you'll never get the time back. ;)</p>\n",
