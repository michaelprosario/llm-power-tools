The Agile movement itself started with the authors of the Agile Manifesto questioning traditional software development methods.</p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Now, in 2025, with significant changes in the industry including PMI's acquisition of the Agile Alliance, the community faces a crucial moment to shape its future direction through thoughtful inquiry and reflection.</p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><em>\"Throughout history, the biggest leaps forward have come from people willing to ask difficult, sometimes even quite challenging, questions.\"</em></p> The Future Beyond Agile <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">\ud83c\udfaf Max asks: <em>What comes after the Agile era? Should we enter the \u2018SmartOrg\u2019 era, where multiple toolboxes thrive?</em></p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">The question of what comes after the Agile era emerges as a central theme in the community submitted questions. While Agile has matured over two and a half decades, it continues to evolve beyond its first-generation frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and XP. The focus shifts toward viewing Agile as a broader philosophy that can be adapted locally with different frameworks, while remaining open to new approaches that may emerge, particularly with the advent of AI and other technological advances.</p> <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">This is only of the many questions we're trying to answer the <a href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolboxPodcast\"> The Global Agile Summit 2025</a>. We\u2019ll be featuring world-class speakers like:</p> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> <ul data-spread=\"false\"> <li>Jurgen Appelo (Management 3.0)</li> <li>Gojko Adzic (Impact Mapping, Specification by Example)</li> <li>Clinton Keith (Agile for Game Development - EXCLUSIVE REVEAL!)</li> <li>\u2026and many more!</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>At the Summit, we\u2019ll be discussing these BIG Agile questions and working together on real-world, actionable solutions.

Modern understanding of concepts like psychological safety and team dynamics challenges traditional management approaches based on Frederick Taylor's scientific management ideas. The Agile community must continue to incorporate insights from psychology to create more effective and humane workplaces.</p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><em>\"Agile is about people, but sometimes we treat teams, organizations, and even people like machines.\"</em></p> The NoEstimates Approach to Delivery <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">\ud83c\udfaf <a href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/andrew-mitchell/\">Andrew Mitchell (a previous guest on the podcast)</a> asks: <em>How can we deliver sooner and meet product deadlines with better forecasting tools?</em></p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">When faced with the challenge of meeting product deadlines and improving delivery forecasting, the traditional estimation approach has proven ineffective. Vasco's research shows that projects are on average 60% late, with larger projects experiencing even greater delays. The solution lies in shifting from rigid prediction expectations to simpler, more effective forecasting tools that combine historical data with human insights. The key strategy for Agilists is to focus on shorter, smaller projects that deliver to production, supported by practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery.</p> <p><a href=\"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/noestimates/\">The NoEstimates movement</a> already shows some options, practical approaches, that we can use to deliver on time. But we are just starting to discover these new approaches. There's more to come.</p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><em>\"If there's one thing we've learned from old school project management, the fading framework that is still the 600 pound gorilla in the room... estimates don't prevent delays.\"</em></p> Leadership in the Age of Specialists <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">\ud83c\udfaf Zvone asks: <em>How can we challenge leaders to step up their involvement while remaining trusted and respected?</em></p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">The evolution of leadership in Agile organizations presents unique challenges. Leaders must balance involvement with trust, influencing while allowing teams to grow and express their potential. The community needs to develop coherent frameworks and tools specifically for leaders, similar to how Scrum serves development teams or product discovery serves product owners.</p> <p>In this segment, we refer to <a href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2017/10/podcast/bonus-david-marquet-on-the-book-turn-the-ship-around-a-true-story-of-building-leaders/\"> David Marquet</a> and his work with <a href= \"https://amzn.to/3QjQ8AY\">Turn The Ship Around!</a> A must-read book for all Agile leaders.</p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><em>\"Leaders are working with teams of specialists, people who know more about the work that they're doing than their leaders do. And that's okay because the leader shouldn't be doing that work.\"</em></p> Executive Engagement and Transformation <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">\ud83c\udfaf Liat Feren asks: <em>How can we engage executives in Agile transformation?</em></p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Understanding and engaging with executives requires speaking their language and focusing on outcomes rather than frameworks. Success stories from the Global Agile Summit demonstrate how organizations can transform when executives are properly engaged and understand the value proposition of Agile approaches.</p> <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><em>\"Executives love outcomes. They don't really care for frameworks.\"</em></p> <p><a href= \"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO16wn5MqLQmYaGLV4o0rtihhwkqSuYyhaHLSo7f4wSVwyNA/viewform?usp=header\"> Submit your questions to our BIG Agile Questions survey!</a> Let's continue to explore the future of Agile together!</p> About Vasco Duarte <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Vasco Duarte is a thought leader in the Agile space, co-founder of Agile Finland, and host of the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast, which has over 10 million downloads.
