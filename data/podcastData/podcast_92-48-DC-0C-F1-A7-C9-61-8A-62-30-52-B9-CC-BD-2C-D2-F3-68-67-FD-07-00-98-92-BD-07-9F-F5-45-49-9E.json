    "Description": "\n        <p>Jimmy Fallon may talk like a comedian, but he thinks like a restless entrepreneur.&nbsp;In addition to his day job as host of <em>The Tonight Show</em>, he runs a TV production company, writes best-selling children\u2019s books, and creates products you never knew you needed, like all-day pajamas and \u201chands high\u201d jerseys that show the name of your favorite team in the armpit. As a kid, Jimmy was&nbsp;obsessed with perfecting his impressions of Richard Pryor and Steve Martin,&nbsp;with the goal of one day starring on Saturday Night Live.&nbsp;After an incredibly successful 6-year run on that show, he tried to make it in film, only to eventually find his way to one of the most coveted jobs in television.&nbsp;Today, he\u2019s constantly generating new ideas, whether for a new TV show, or a Christmas tchotchke called Elvis on the Shelvis.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
