    "Description": "<p>AI applications are evolving beyond chatbots into more complex and transformative solutions, according to Marco Palladino, CTO and co-founder of Kong. In a recent episode of The New Stack Makers, he discussed the rise of AI agents, which act as \"virtual employees\" to enhance organizational efficiency. For instance, AI can now function as a product manager for APIs\u2014analyzing documentation, detecting inaccuracies, and making corrections.</p><p>However, reliance on AI agents brings security risks, such as data leakage and governance challenges. Organizations need observability and safeguards, but developers often resist implementing these requirements manually. As GenAI adoption matures, teams seek ways to accelerate development without rebuilding security measures repeatedly.</p><p>To address these challenges, Kong introduced AI Gateway, an open-source plugin for its API Gateway. AI Gateway supports multiple AI models across providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google, offering developers a universal API to integrate AI securely and efficiently. It also features automated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to minimize hallucinations.</p><p>Palladino emphasized the need for consistent security in AI infrastructure, ensuring developers can focus on innovation while leveraging built-in protections.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Kong\u2019s AI Gateway</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/kong-new-ai-infused-features-for-api-management-dev-tools/\">Kong: New \u2018AI-Infused\u2019 Features for API Management, Dev Tools</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/from-zero-to-a-terraform-provider-for-kong-in-120-hours/\">From Zero to a Terraform Provider for Kong in 120 Hours</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
