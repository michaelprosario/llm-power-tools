    "Description": "<p>We dive into some of the ways developers can customize their keyboard with shortcuts, macros, and apps to eliminate repetitive tasks and automate the busywork that stands in the way of bigger, breakthrough innovations.\u00a0</p><p>Flow state can be affected by things as simple as the right lighting, so Logitech created <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/mx/mx-for-coding.html\">keyboards that automatically adjust their keyboard backlighting</a>.\u00a0</p><p>For those not familiar with the MX series, you can read more about the different versions, including the mechanical one, <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/mx/master-series.html\">here</a>.</p><p>If you don\u2019t know about Cassidy\u2019s passion for keyboards, you can check out her website <a href=\"https://cassidoo.co/\">here</a> or listen to a previous episode diving deep into the details of mechanical keyboards <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/22/the-stack-overflow-podcast-episode-125-tilde-club-mechanical-keyboards/\">here</a>.</p><p>If you missed episode two, you can check it out below. In it, we chat with Marcel Twohig, Head of Design for the MX Series at Logitech, and Thomas Fritz, Associate Professor of Human Aspects of Software Engineering at the University of Zurich. We cover the research that Professor Fritz has done on flow states, the design work that Marcel and team have done to incorporate that research, and the tools that you can use to maximize your daily flow.</p>\n",
