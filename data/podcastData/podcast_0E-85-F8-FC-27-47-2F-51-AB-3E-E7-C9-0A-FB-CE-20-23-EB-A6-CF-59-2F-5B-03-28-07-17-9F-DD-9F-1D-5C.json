    "Description": "<p>Rey Ortega is an incredibly smart, well-read, and self-taught programming engineer that is driven to help others reach their goals and potential. His mentoring advice to others is \u201cMake sure you do a deep dive and become a problem solver. Apply this in everything you want to learn. If you don\u2019t know your stuff, people will know you don\u2019t know what you are doing.\u201d Wise words, right? \u00a0</p>\n<p>We talked quite a bit about AI and how it can be used with impact both positively and negatively. \u00a0<br>\nFrom a technical perspective, what worries him about 2030 is that a lot of technology will take over things that people used to do. People will feel disenfranchised and left behind. Humans are important, it is bothersome low code, no code solutions, someone has to own the data and it may not be you the owner of an idea. Listeners, dive into this episode and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Reach out to Rey on Linkedin to hire his company, have him speak about AI in the Future, or have a cup of coffee with him. He is the real deal.</p>\n<p>Websites: \u00a0https://www.gratasoftware.com and LearnToBuildABusiness\u00a0<br>\nLinkedIn: \u00a0 https://www.linkedin.com/in/rey-ortega-2774468/\u00a0<br>\nEmail: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0rey@gratasoftware.com\u00a0<br>\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gratasoftware/\u00a0<br>\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gratasoftware</p>\n<p><br>\nWe hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Intern Whisperer Podcast is brought to you by Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
