    "Description": "<p>John Couch, Apple's first VP of Education hired by Steve Jobs, talks about education as it should be. From the early research from Apple to current technologies, learn about what we should be doing in education with challenge based learning. <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e391\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e391</a>\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Today's sponsor: <a href=\"http://www.projectpals.com\">Project Pals</a> has a useful classroom collaborative platform that lets you create and manage projects for your students. Right now, my students are creating and managing a project as they are creating a podcast to record powerful stories from the recent storms in our area. Project Pals connects with Google Classroom but also lets me see the detail on which students are contributing and participating. I also love the task board which is a Trello-like Kanban board that let students create, assign, and complete tasks. I wrote a <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/project-pals-perfect-pbl-software-project-based-learning/\"> review on Project Pals.</a></p>",
