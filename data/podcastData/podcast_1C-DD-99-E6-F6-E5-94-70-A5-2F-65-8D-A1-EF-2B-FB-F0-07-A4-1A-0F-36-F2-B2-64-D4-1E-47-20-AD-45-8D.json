    "Description": "<p>Fortnite has a physics engine in the game. Unknown to many educators, Fortnite has three modes of play. While Battle Royale is a first-person shooter, the creative mode is not. Some educators are creating private islands (for free) that their students can make Rube Goldberg machines and other creations. Today's guest, Mike Washburn, is on the educator advisory board for Fortnite. He takes us through lessons that teachers are teaching in Fornite and also the two warnings that educators need to keep in mind when teaching with this tool.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e612\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e612</a>\u00a0</p>  Sponsor: Adobe I use Adobe Premiere Rush to teach digital filmmaking in my classroom.
