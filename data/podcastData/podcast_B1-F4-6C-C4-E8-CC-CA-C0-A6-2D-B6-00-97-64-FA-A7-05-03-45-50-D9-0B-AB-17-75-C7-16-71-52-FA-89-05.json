    "Description": "<p>Let\u2019s say you had a passion but thought of it only as a hobby; certainly never the seed of a billion-dollar company. Plus, you are studying&nbsp;for a career in something unrelated to business. That\u2019s Maureen Kelly\u2019s story, CEO of Tarte Cosmetics. She was pursuing a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and already had TWO Master\u2019s degrees when she realized she didn't want that to be her career.&nbsp;What she wanted was to&nbsp;launch a makeup company\u2014despite having no significant start-up money, no experience, and no connections.&nbsp;How she did it is a story of pure moxie. She relentlessly knocked on the doors of chemists, manufacturers, retailers, and the fashion&nbsp;press. She maxed out her credit cards and enlisted the help of friends and family, turning Tarte into a wildly successful brand.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
