    "Description": "<p>Mike Hanley, Chief Security Officer and SVP of Engineering @ GitHub, joins us to discuss how GitHub has successfully combined its engineering & security orgs and shares recommendations for how other orgs can pivot to this model. We cover why it\u2019s so important for eng orgs to collaborate with security early on in the product development cycle and tips for educating your engineers on security best practices. We also discuss how the rise of AI tools / usage is changing how companies need to think about & practice security, why AI is providing opportunities for increased safety & security within product development, and strategies for encouraging your org to adopt AI tooling within engineering, security, and beyond.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT MIKE HANLEY</strong></h2><p>Mike Hanley is the Chief Security Officer and SVP of Engineering at GitHub. Prior to GitHub, Mike was the Vice President of Security at Duo Security, where he built and led the security research, development, and operations functions. After Duo\u2019s acquisition by Cisco for $2.35 billion in 2018, Mike led the transformation of Cisco\u2019s cloud security framework and later served as CISO for the company. Mike also spent several years at CERT/CC as a Senior Member of the Technical Staff and security researcher focused on applied R&D programs for the US Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community.</p><p>When he\u2019s not talking about security at GitHub, Mike can be found enjoying Ann Arbor, MI with his wife and eight kids.</p><blockquote><p>\"The idea that the security team is walled off or separate or not really connected, not just to engineering but the entirety of the business, you really can't have that. If you think about the pace of modern development, things are moving so quickly. It's so driven by software. The idea that you're like, \u2018Hey, I got to walk down the hall and check in with somebody from security who has no idea what's going on in my roadmap, who has no idea what my day to day experience is living in engineering...\u2019 That just doesn't work!\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Mike Hanley \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>We\u2019re less than one week away from <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/glow/?utm_source=elc&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=glow-2024-promo&utm_content=text&utm_term=register\">GLOW 2024</a></h3><p>Attend GLOW 2024 - <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/\">Jellyfish\u2019s</a> virtual summit for engineering, product, and finance leaders who are looking to deliver greater business impact while building great software and teams.
