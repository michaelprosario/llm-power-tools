    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.wix.com/\">Wix</a> is a cloud-based development site for making <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/html-5-1-replaces-html-5-w3c-standard/\">HTML 5</a> websites and mobile sites with drag and drop tools. It is suited for the beginning user or the advanced developer, said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hila-fish/?originalSubdomain=il\">Hila Fish</a>, senior DevOps engineer for Wix, in an interview for <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/podcasts/\">The New Stack Makers</a> at <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/\">HashiCorp\u2019s</a> HashiConf Global conference in Los Angeles earlier this month.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our questions for Fish focused on <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/terraform-cloud-now-offers-less-code-and-no-code-options/\">Terraform</a>, the open source infrastructure-as-code software tool:</p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>How has Terraform evolved in uses since Fish started using it in 2018?</li><li>How does Wix make the most of Terraform to scale its infrastructure?</li><li>What are some best practices Wix has used with Terraform?</li><li>What are some pitfalls to avoid with Terraform?</li><li>What is the approach to scaling across teams and avoiding refactoring to keep the integrations elegant and working</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p>Fish started using Terraform in an ad-hoc manner back in 2018. Over time she has learned how to use it for scaling operations.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you want to scale your infrastructure, you need to use Terraform in a way that will allow you to do that,\u201d Fish said.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Terraform can be used ad-hoc to create a machine as a resource, but scale comes with enabling infrastructure that allows the engineers to develop templates that get reused across many servers.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou need to use it in a way that will allow you to scale up as much as you can,\u201d Fish said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Fish said best practices come from how to structure the Terraform code base.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Much of it comes down to the teams and how Terraform gets implemented. Engineers each have their way of working. Standard practices can help. In onboarding new teams, a structured code base can be beneficial. New teams onboard and use models already in the code base.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And what are some of the pitfalls of using Terraform?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We get to that in the recording and more about integrations, why Wix is still on version 0.13, and some new capabilities for developers to use Terraform.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Users have historically needed to learn HashiCorp configuration language (HCL) to use the HashiCorp configuration language. At Wix, Fish said, the company is implementing Terraform on the backend with a UI that developers can use without needing to learn HCL.</p>\n",
