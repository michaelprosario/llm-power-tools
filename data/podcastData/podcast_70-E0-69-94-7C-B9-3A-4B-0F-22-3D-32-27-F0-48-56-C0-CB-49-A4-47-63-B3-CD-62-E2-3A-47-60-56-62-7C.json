    "Description": "<p>Bhavini Soneji, VP of Product Engineering @ Cruise, shares her leadership journey & how she gained cross-functional experience working at both large & small organizations. We cover how to gain product experience alongside engineering, deciding which elements of your org to mature/invest in, why you should examine the role of fear in your decision-making, and strategies for asking for more experience & opportunities to gain confidence.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavinisoneji/\"><strong>BHAVINI SONEJI</strong></a></h2><p>Bhavini loves using human-centered design with streamlined automation to create experiences that improve people\u2019s lives. Previously, she has led teams through different growth stages at Microsoft, Snapchat, Headspace, and Heal. Additionally, she enjoys giving back to the community, advising C-level executives, mentoring at Techstars, First Round, and has also founded a group of Women Technology Executives in Los Angeles to support and foster this group while playing an active role in the LA CTO Forum. When she\u2019s not working, she loves the outdoors and enjoys boogie boarding with her husband and twins.</p><blockquote><p>\"Just knowing kind of the imposter syndrome that is holding you back. For me, it is like I'm always having a very high bar so am I hitting myself more and how do I be kind to myself? How do I support myself better? So I think that's one thing first, looking back and saying, 'No. I've done this, this, this. So my fears are not true, otherwise, I wouldn't be here.'\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Bhavini Soneji \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Check out our friends and sponsor,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/sfelc/Jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a></h2><p>To learn more about Jellyfish and how they can help you increase engineering satisfaction and create happier, higher-performing engineering teams.</p><h3><strong>Learn more at</strong> <a href=\"http://jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish.co/elc</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>Join us for one of our in-person community events!</strong></h2><p>That's right!
