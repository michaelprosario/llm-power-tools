    "Description": "<p>As the pandemic starts to wind down in some parts of the world, the conversation is turning to - do we go back to the office? Richard talks to Martina Grom about how some of her customers are responding to a need for hybrid workspaces, with some mixture of working from home and in the office. Martina also digs into the governance challenges of M365 with hybrid workers, and how folks who moved quickly to the cloud during the pandemic are still struggling to use their tools in a sustainable way. There's lots to learn still!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.office.com/\">Microsoft 365</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description\">Microsoft Defender for Office 365</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/delegate-invitations\">Guest Access to Azure Active Directory</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.governancetoolkit365.com/\">Governance Toolkit 365</a></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p>Recorded June 30, 2021</p>\n",
