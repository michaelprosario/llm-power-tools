    "Description": "\n        <p>A life-threatening diagnosis changed the course of Andrew Abraham\u2019s career and led him to found some of the most popular nutritional drinks and powders on the market. After recovering from his illness and attending med school, Andrew noticed that some of his patients\u2014just as he had\u2014struggled with keeping food down.&nbsp;So during his first year of residency, he developed the same kind of organic nutritional shakes that he\u2019d made for himself when he was sick. Andrew launched Orgain in 2009 as a side business, but after he got a big order from Whole Foods, the business quickly grew, despite the fact that he was running it pretty much on his own\u2014while practicing medicine.&nbsp;Only after joining his father\u2019s clinic did Andrew realize his side business needed his full-time attention.&nbsp;He has continued to grow Orgain&nbsp;into a substantial wellness company, in which Nestle acquired a majority stake in 2022.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Liz Metzger, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Sam Paulson.</p><p>You can follow HIBT on Twitter &amp; Instagram, and email us at <em>hibt@id.wondery.com.</em></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
