    "SourceUrl": "https://www.superdatascience.com/865",
    "Description": "\n        <p>Jon Krohn talks to Cal Al-Dhubaib about the extraordinary success of AI and machine learning solutions provider Pandata, his ironclad hack for any company to define their core values, and how to attract and secure loyal clients. Cal thinks tech professionals make two critical mistakes in their careers: The first is that they too-often enjoy being the gatekeepers of their work rather than educating their clients and coworkers as to the details of their projects and why it benefits the company. The second is that tech professionals don\u2019t show vulnerability, whether that means not knowing a topic or not fully understanding how a business works. This issue, Cal says, can spell the difference between a startup\u2019s success and failure. Learn how tech startups can make an ironclad strategy for their future in this episode of The SuperDataScience Podcast.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://odsc.com/boston/\">ODSC</a>, the Open Data Science Conference.
