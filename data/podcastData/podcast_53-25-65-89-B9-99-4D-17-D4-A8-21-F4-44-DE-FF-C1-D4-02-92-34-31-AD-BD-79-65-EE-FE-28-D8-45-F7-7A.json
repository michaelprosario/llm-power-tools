    "Description": "<p>How do you reduce problem behaviors? Could it be as simple as acting out negative behaviors? Todd Clinton is a special education teacher in a middle school. He works with students with behavioral disabilities, typically autism, ADHD, and EMD. He was previously a banker, before deciding to pursue my passion of working with kids. He is a proud dad to one and loves teachers so much he married one.</p> <p>In today's show, special education teacher Todd Clinton discusses his \"School Perfect\" YouTube project and how it is reducing negative behaviors in his school. Todd also discusses how all teachers can work to reduce problem behaviors through acting out negative stereotypes. Finally, Todd's discussion of how his project has evolved and grown through the year is a perfect example of my own innovation strategy, \"Innovate Like a Turtle.\" This show has practical examples that teachers can use.</p> <p>A full transcript of this show and the show notes are available at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast\">www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast</a> as well as details on entering this month\u2019s giveaway contests.</p>",
