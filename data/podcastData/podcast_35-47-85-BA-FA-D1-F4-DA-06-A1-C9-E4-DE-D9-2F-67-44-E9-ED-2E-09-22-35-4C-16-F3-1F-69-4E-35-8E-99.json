    "Description": "<p>Murray Shanahan is a professor of Cognitive Robotics at Imperial College London and a senior research scientist at DeepMind. He challenges our assumptions about AI consciousness and urges us to rethink how we talk about machine intelligence. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We explore the dangers of anthropomorphizing AI, the limitations of current language in describing AI capabilities, and the fascinating intersection of philosophy and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Show notes and full references: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ICtBI574W-xGi8Z2ZtUNeKWiOiGZ_DRsp9EnyYAISws/edit?usp=sharing </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Prof Murray Shanahan:</p>\n<p>https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpsha/ (look at his selected publications)</p>\n<p>https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=00bnGpAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Shanahan </p>\n<p>https://x.com/mpshanahan </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Interviewer: Dr. Tim Scarfe</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Refs (links in the Google doc linked above):</p>\n<p>Role play with large language models</p>\n<p>Waluigi effect</p>\n<p>&quot;Conscious Exotica&quot; - Paper by Murray Shanahan (2016)</p>\n<p>&quot;Simulators&quot; - Article by Janis from LessWrong</p>\n<p>&quot;Embodiment and the Inner Life&quot; - Book by Murray Shanahan (2010)</p>\n<p>&quot;The Technological Singularity&quot; - Book by Murray Shanahan (2015)</p>\n<p>&quot;Simulacra as Conscious Exotica&quot; - Paper by Murray Shanahan (newer paper of the original focussed on LLMs)</p>\n<p>A recent paper by Anthropic on using autoencoders to find features in language models (referring to the &quot;Scaling Monosemanticity&quot; paper)</p>\n<p>Work by Peter Godfrey-Smith on octopus consciousness</p>\n<p>&quot;Metaphors We Live By&quot; - Book by George Lakoff (1980s)</p>\n<p>Work by Aaron Sloman on the concept of &quot;space of possible minds&quot; (1984 article mentioned)</p>\n<p>Wittgenstein&#39;s &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; (posthumously published)</p>\n<p>Daniel Dennett&#39;s work on the &quot;intentional stance&quot;</p>\n<p>Alan Turing&#39;s original paper on the Turing Test (1950)</p>\n<p>Thomas Nagel&#39;s paper &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot; (1974)</p>\n<p>John Searle&#39;s Chinese Room Argument (mentioned but not detailed)</p>\n<p>Work by Richard Evans on tackling reasoning problems</p>\n<p>Claude Shannon&#39;s quote on knowledge and control</p>\n<p>&quot;Are We Bodies or Souls?&quot; - Book by Richard Swinburne</p>\n<p>Reference to work by Ethan Perez and others at Anthropic on potential deceptive behavior in language models</p>\n<p>Reference to a paper by Murray Shanahan and Antonia Creswell on the &quot;selection inference framework&quot;</p>\n<p>Mention of work by Francois Chollet, particularly the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenge</p>\n<p>Reference to Elizabeth Spelke&#39;s work on core knowledge in infants</p>\n<p>Mention of Karl Friston&#39;s work on planning as inference (active inference)</p>\n<p>The film &quot;Ex Machina&quot; - Murray Shanahan was the scientific advisor</p>\n<p>&quot;The Waluigi Effect&quot;</p>\n<p>Anthropic&#39;s constitutional AI approach</p>\n<p>Loom system by Lara Reynolds and Kyle McDonald for visualizing conversation trees</p>\n<p>DeepMind&#39;s AlphaGo (mentioned multiple times as an example)</p>\n<p>Mention of the &quot;Golden Gate Claude&quot; experiment</p>\n<p>Reference to an interview Tim Scarfe conducted with University of Toronto students about self-attention controllability theorem</p>\n<p>Mention of an interview with Irina Rish</p>\n<p>Reference to an interview Tim Scarfe conducted with Daniel Dennett</p>\n<p>Reference to an interview with Maria Santa Caterina</p>\n<p>Mention of an interview with Philip Goff</p>\n<p>Nick Chater and Martin Christianson&#39;s book (&quot;The Language Game: How Improvisation Created Language and Changed the World&quot;)</p>\n<p>Peter Singer&#39;s work from 1975 on ascribing moral status to conscious beings</p>\n<p>Demis Hassabis&#39; discussion on the &quot;ladder of creativity&quot;</p>\n<p>Reference to B.F.
