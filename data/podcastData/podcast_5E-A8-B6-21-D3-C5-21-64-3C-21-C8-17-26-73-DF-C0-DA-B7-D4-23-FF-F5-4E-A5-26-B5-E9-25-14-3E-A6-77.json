    "Description": "<p>VALENCIA, SPAIN \u2014Managing the cloud virtual machines (VMs) your containers run on. Running <a href=\"/category/data/\">data-intensive workloads</a>. Scaling services in response to spikes in traffic \u2014\u00a0but doing so in a way that doesn\u2019t jack up your organization\u2019s cloud spend. <a href=\"/category/kubernetes/\">Kubernetes (K8s)</a> seems so easy at the beginning, but it brings challenges that rachet up complexity as you go.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The <a href=\"/category/cloud-native/\">cloud native</a> ecosystem is filling up with tools aimed at making these challenges easier on developers, data scientists and Ops engineers. Increasingly, automation is the secret sauce helping teams and their companies work faster, safer and more productively.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In this special On the Road edition of The New Stack Makers podcast recorded at [sponsor_inline_mention slug=\"kubecon-cloudnativecon\" ]KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU[/sponsor_inline_mention], we unpacked some of the ways automation helps simplify Kubernetes. We were joined by a trio of guests from [sponsor_inline_mention slug=\"netapp\" ]Spot.io by NetApp[/sponsor_inline_mention]: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jystephan/\">Jean-Yves \u201cJY\u201d Stephan</a>, senior product manager \u00a0for Ocean for Apache Spark, along with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilad-shahar-0320a589/\">Gilad Shahar</a>, \u200band <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yarin-pinyan-385b28176/\">Yarin Pinyan</a> \u2014product manager and \u00a0product architect, respectively, for Spot.io.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Until recently, Stephan noted, <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\">Apache Spark</a>, the open source, unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, couldn\u2019t be deployed on K8s. \u201cSo all these regular software engineers were getting the cool technology with Kubernetes, cloud native solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the big data engineers, they were stuck with technologies from 10 years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Spot.io, he said, lets Apache Spark run atop Kubernetes: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more developer friendly, it\u2019s a lot more flexible and it can also be more cost effective.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The company\u2019s Ocean CD, expected to be generally available in August, is aimed at solving another Kubernetes problem, said Pinyan: canary deployments.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Previously, if you were running normal VMs, without Kubernetes, it was pretty easy to do canary deployments because you had to scale up a VM and then see if the new version worked fine on it, and then gradually scale the others,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Kubernetes, it\u2019s pretty complex, because you have to deal with many pods and deployments.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In enterprises, where DevOps and SRE team members are likely serving multitudes of developers, automating as much toil as possible for devs is essential, said Shahar. For instance, Spot.io\u2019s tools allow users to \u201cbreak the configuration into parts,\u201d he said, which can task developers with whatever percentage of responsibility for the config that is deemed best for their use case.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe try to design our solutions in a way that will allow the DevOps [team] to set things once and basically provide pre-baked solutions for the developers,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the developer, at the end of the day, knows best what their application will require.\u201d</p>\n",
