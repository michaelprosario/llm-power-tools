    "Description": "<p>How does Office 365 help teams collaborate? Richard chats with Tony Redmond about his insights into Microsoft's on-going effort to make Office 365 the most efficient place for people to work together. Tony talks about two primary hubs of team work - collaboration around email and collaboration around chat. The chat product is, of course, the new Office 365 Teams. The conversation dives into how different people like to collaborate in different ways, and that Office 365 has carved out spaces so that all those styles of collaboration can work together. Some conversations are best suited to Teams, some are best suited to Outlook, and you don't have to choose one or the other. Just don't store files in email!</p>\n",
