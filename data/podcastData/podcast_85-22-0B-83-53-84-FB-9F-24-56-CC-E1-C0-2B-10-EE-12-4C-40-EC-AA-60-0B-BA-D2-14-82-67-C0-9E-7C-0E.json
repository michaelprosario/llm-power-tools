    "SourceUrl": "https://www.runasradio.com/",
    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Mark Minasi about the events of 2011 that happened and didn't happen. The conversation starts with Windows 8 and the Build conference - is it going to succeed? The debate drills into the role of the tablet in the enterprise. Next topic is IPv6. 2011 is the year that IANA ran out of IPv4 addresses, but the world didn't end. When will IPv6 ascend? Finally, Mark and Richard chat about the Kinect and the next generation of user interfaces. What a great year - and 2012 looks awesome. Happy New Year!</p>\n",
