    "Description": "<p>\u00a0\u00a0Meet Rafael Caamano, a gentleman that I have known at events for years and finally had the opportunity to have a conversation with him about his life. I hope you enjoy meeting him as much as me. Sharing one of the stories from this episode with you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When asked who are some of his favorite thought leaders. His reply was different from others.\u00a0 He shared a story about the quality time he spent with each of his grandfathers. Both of his grandfathers were very different from one another.\u00a0 One was a community leader and the other was a businessman with no educational background. Both were veterans. The grandfather that was a community leader spent his time on the corner with his friends. He came to realize that each of them brought something significant to his life about building relationships and brought something to the table.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another highlight Rafael shared is that as most growing teenage boys, he loved food and wanted to help provide for his family when they moved from Puerto Rico to Florida. He started shining shoes to buy empanadas. He also loved grapes and asked to volunteer and put pricing labels on cans in the grocery store in exchange for grapes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
