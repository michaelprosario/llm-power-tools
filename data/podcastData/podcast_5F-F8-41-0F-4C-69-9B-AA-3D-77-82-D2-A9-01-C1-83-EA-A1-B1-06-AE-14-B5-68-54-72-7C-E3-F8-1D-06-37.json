    "Description": "<p>How can backups protect you from ransomware? Richard chats with Karinne Bessette about how backup technology has responded to the need for ransomware protection. Whether it's intelligent backup tape systems that automatically pop out tapes so they won't overwrite or other air-gap strategies for backups, you need to have a backup you can rely on to recover from a ransomware attack without paying the ransom. Backups can also be a part of the requirements for ransomware insurance - and if your backups aren't sufficient, they can void the insurance! It is also crucial to know what it takes to restore from backup, how long it takes, and the order of things when recovering, even from the ground up. Backups aren't going away any time soon!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/compliance/assurance/assurance-malware-and-ransomware-protection\">Malware and Ransomware Protection in Microsoft 365</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.veeam.com/disaster-recovery-orchestrator.html\">Veeam Disaster Recovery Orchestrator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/management-business-continuity-disaster-recovery\">Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/overview\">Microsoft Sentinel</a></li></ul><p>Recorded March 25, 2022</p>\n",
