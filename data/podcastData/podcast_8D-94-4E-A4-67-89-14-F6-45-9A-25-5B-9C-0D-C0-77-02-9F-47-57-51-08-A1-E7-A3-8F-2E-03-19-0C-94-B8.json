Peggy is an expert on getting the most of ISTE by attending virtually. Today, she'll teach five tips for getting the most out of ISTE whether you're at ISTE or riding home on the plane and wanting to see what you missed.\u00a0</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by Powerschool. I am so excited to be at ISTE with PowerSchool on Monday, June 26th, 2017 at 4 p.m. in room 225 A and B. I will be leading a panel discussion on the 5 teacher trends changing education. You will also want to come by PowerSchool\u2019s Classroom of the Future in 207A where they will be giving away Apple Watches, Microsoft Surfaces and Amazon Echos.
