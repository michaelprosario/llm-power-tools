    "Description": "<p>Happy Digital Learning Day! The challenge with digital learning is that it is still new and different to many people. However, there is research growing out of the social media learning that is happening online.</p> <p>For Thought Leader Thursday, social media researcher Laura Pasquini explains three defining aspects of effective social media powered professional development. In today's show, we'll discuss:</p> <ul> <li>The impact of \"watercooler\" pd online</li> <li>Best practices for hashtag maintenance and open learning</li> <li>The lessons learned from effective social media PD</li> </ul> <p>This story is intriguing because so many still define PD the same old way. If we can upgrade our knowledge based on current research, we can not only create better professional development opportunities for teachers, but we can become better online participants. There is no doubt that community organizing has moved online in the education world. Many amazing people chat, catalog and archive, and maintain thriving social media \"water coolers\" from around the web. I hope you enjoy this episode with Laura!</p> <p>A full transcript of this show and the show notes are available at <a contenteditable=\"plaintext-only\" href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer\">www.coolcatteacher.com/podcast</a> as well as details on entering this month\u2019s giveaway contests.</p>",
