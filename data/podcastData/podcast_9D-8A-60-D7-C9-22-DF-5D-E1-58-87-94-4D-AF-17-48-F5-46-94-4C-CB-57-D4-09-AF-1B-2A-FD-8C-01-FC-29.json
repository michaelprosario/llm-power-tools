    "Title": "The creator of Homebrew has a plan to fix the funding problem in open source",
    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>Over the years Homebrew, an open source package manager, has emerged as the project with the greatest number of individual contributors. Despite all that, it\u2019s creator Max Howell, couldn\u2019t make a living off the occasional charity of the millions of people who used the software he built. <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2347/\">This XKCD cartoon</a> is probably the most frequently repeated joke on the podcast over the last three years.</p><p>While he is not a crypto bull, Max was inspired with a solution for the open source funding dilemma\u00a0 by his efforts to buy and sell an NFT. A contract written in code and shared in public enforced a rule sending a portion of his proceeds to the digital objects original creator. What if the same funding mechanism could be applied to open source projects?\u00a0</p><p>In March of 2022, Max and his co-founder launched <a href=\"https://tea.xyz/\">Tea</a>, a sort of spirtual successor to Homebrew. It has a lot of new features Max wanted in a package manager, plus a blockchain based approach to ensuring that creators, maintainers, and contributors of open source software can all get paid for their efforts.\u00a0</p><p>You can read Max\u2019s launch post on Tea <a href=\"https://medium.com/teaxyz/tea-brew-478a9e736638\">here</a> and yes, of course there is a <a href=\"https://tea.xyz/white-paper/\">white paper</a>.
