    "Description": "<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is only as moral and as good as those who create it. Today,\u00a0AI ethics thought-leader Joe Fatheree and I discuss this topic.</p> <p>Without discussing the ethics of AI and its algorithms, we risk opening the ultimate Pandora\u2019s box of technology problems when we should instead work to get hope out of the AI box and keep the demons that could misuse and abuse us locked away. I\u2019m not too sure we currently have the moral capacity and knowledge of right and wrong to wisely use AI. Either way, AI is here and we can be part of the conversation or we can sit in the corner and say \u201cNah Nah Nah I can\u2019t hear you\u201d until AI hears us and builds a cage around our little corner from which we cannot escape because ultimately, the key to any technology is crafted by those who make themselves part of the conversation.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/472\">www.coolcatteacher.com/472</a></p> <p>***</p> <p>Sponsor: <a href= \"https://www.advancementcourses.com/courses?utm_source=coolcatteacher&utm_medium=influencer&tid=2750899&utm_campaign=podcast_april19&utm_content=show7_04162019\"> Advancement Courses</a>, a 30-year leader in teacher PD, is kicking off their Spring Sale!
