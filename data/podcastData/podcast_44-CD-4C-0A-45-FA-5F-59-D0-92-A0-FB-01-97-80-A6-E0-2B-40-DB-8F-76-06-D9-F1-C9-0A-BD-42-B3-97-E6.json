    "Description": "<p>Nathan Peck, a senior developer advocate for generative AI at Amazon Web Services (AWS), shares his experiences working with Python in a recent episode of The New Stack Makers, recorded at PyCon US. Although not a Python expert, Peck frequently deals with Python scripts in his role, often assisting colleagues in running scripts as cron jobs. He highlights the challenge of being a T-shaped developer, possessing broad knowledge across multiple languages and frameworks but deep expertise in only a few.</p><p>Peck introduces Amazon Q, a generative AI coding assistant launched by AWS in November, and demonstrates its capabilities. The assistant can be integrated into an integrated development environment (IDE) like VS Code. It assists in explaining, refactoring, fixing, and even developing new features for Python codebases. Peck emphasizes Amazon Q's ability to surface best practices from extensive AWS documentation, making it easier for developers to navigate and apply.</p><p>Amazon Q Developer is available for free to users with an AWS Builder ID, without requiring an AWS cloud account. Peck's demo showcases how this tool can simplify and enhance the coding experience, especially for those handling complex or unfamiliar codebases.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Amazon Q and Amazon\u2019s Generative AI strategy:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/amazon-q-a-genai-to-understand-aws-and-your-business-docs/\">Amazon Q, a GenAI to Understand AWS (and Your Business Docs)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/decoding-amazons-generative-ai-strategy/\">Decoding Amazon\u2019s Generative AI Strategy</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/responsible-ai-at-amazon-web-services-qa-with-diya-wynn/\">Responsible AI at Amazon Web Services: Q&A with Diya Wynn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.</a>\u00a0</p>\n",
