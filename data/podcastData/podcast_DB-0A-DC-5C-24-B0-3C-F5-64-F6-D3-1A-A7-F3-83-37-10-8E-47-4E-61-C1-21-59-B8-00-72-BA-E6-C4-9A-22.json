    "Description": "<p>Hey, it's the 200th show! Richard and Greg invite Kim Tripp and Paul Randal to share a celebration of the past 200 shows. This may not be the most technical show we've ever done, but hey, you only do 200 shows once! Topics range over SQL Server training, water cooled PCs, bursting aquariums and some of the history of RunAs Radio. The show ends with an oddly serious discussion on performance tuning. Thanks for listening!</p>\n",
