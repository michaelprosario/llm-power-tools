    "Description": "\n        Do you have a really big dream or far-out goal that you\u2019ve never told anybody about? We\u2019ll bet you do because we\u2019ve had them too. What\u2019s sad is that most of those dreams \u00a0get buried under a huge mound of fear and insecurity. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way! We\u2019ve felt that same fear of acting on our deepest desires. And we\u2019ve learned from experience that when you do take the risk of sharing your dream, people usually tell you \u201cget real\u201d or \u201cbe practical.\u201d It\u2019s discouraging. After a while, it\u2019s just easier to play it safe. Here\u2019s the thing: nothing good in our lives has come from thinking small. All the breakthroughs\u2014every single one\u2014have come as a result of dreaming big and nurturing those dreams to reality. Thinking big is a skill, just like anything else. You can train yourself to it, and we\u2019ll show you how. I (Megan) had to learn that lesson to overcome my lifelong fear of public speaking. To do that, I had to envision a bigger future for myself. In this episode, I share that journey and how it transformed my life and leadership. We\u2019re excited about this message because we know it will be a turning point for a lot of people, maybe you. This episode is brought to you by the Full-Focus Planner. Pre-order in the Executive, Classic, and Bold lines. Here\u2019s the insight you get in this episode\u2014  Learn why the biggest change you need is in your mindset, not your behavior. Identify the primary emotion that keeps us from dreaming big. Recognize the predictable process that causes you to give up on big ideas. Find out why writing down your dreams nearly guarantees they\u2019ll be realized. Understand the difference between a dream and a goal, and why both matter. Discover the most vulnerable stage in thinking big, and learn how to ensure your dream doesn\u2019t die here. Hear the magic question that moves you from dreaming to doing. See why most big dreams are not achieved. (Hint: It\u2019s not lack of ability.)  Seriously, this is one of the most exciting episodes we\u2019ve produced. We hope it\u2019ll inspire you to dig deep, think back, and recover the big ambition you\u2019ve been too afraid to voice. We know you can do it!
