    "Description": "<p>My goal is to read books for an hour each night. In this episode, I wanted to share some of the books that have me thinking this summer. It is a wide assortment of books that I've linked to at the bottom of the show. From technology to interpersonal skills to ponderings from history, sometimes patterns emerge between random books in surprising ways. If you have books you'd like to suggest for my reading list, message me on Twitter or use the <a href=\"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/contact/\">contact us</a> form on my website. I'd love to hear what you're reading!</p> <p>Today\u2019s sponsor is\u00a0<a href= \"https://legacy.smarttech.com/en/lumio?utm_source=cool-cat-teacher&utm_medium=podcast&utm_content=lumio&utm_campaign=cool-cat-teacher-q1-2022\">Lum.io</a>, an award-winning digital learning tool that will transform your lessons into active, collaborative learning experiences If you\u2019re looking for a collaborative learning tool to make it easy to level up your lesson materials you already have with assessments, game-based activities, collaborative spaces and lots more all in one place, Lumio is the perfect choice for you.

I also programmed an <a href= \"https://www.descript.com/overdub\">AI voice</a> to overdub a few places where I made a mistake (instead of recording a word here or there.) I did have to give it permission (in my voice) and permit it to create a Voice clone of me. So far, I'm pretty impressed.</p> <p>As a note, this summer I'm also learning about AI and testing many apps like Descript to see where AI tools and assistants can help me be a better teacher and continue to share what I'm learning with those who find it interesting and helpful. You'll see lots of info on past blog posts and in my newsletter.</p> <p>Notes - <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e787\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e787</a></p> <p>I hope you'll listen to the show to see my thoughts on this assortment of books mentioned in this episode.</p> <ul> <li>To Access Your Kindle \"notebook\" if you take notes in your Kindle - <a href= \"https://read.amazon.com/notebook\">read.amazon.com/notebook</a>\u00a0</li> <li><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3RpVhXc\">Love is the Killer App</a> by Tim Sanders</li> <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Iy5VHi\">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> by Dale Carnegie</li> <li> <p class=\"a-spacing-none a-text-normal\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3c8dQyX\">How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking</a> by S\u00f6nke Ahrens\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p class=\"a-spacing-none a-text-normal\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IvLQ4A\">The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race</a> by Walter Isaacson</p> </li> <li> <p class=\"a-spacing-none a-text-normal\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aCY92m\">The Future is Faster Than You Think: How Converging Technologies are Transforming Business, Industries and Our Lives</a> by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler</p> </li> <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Rtr8qf\">The Tech-Wise Family: Every Day Steps for Putting Technology in Its Proper Place</a> by Andy Crouch</li> <li><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3yYKrAz\">Keep Going: 10 Ways to Stay Creative in Good Times and Bad</a> by Austin Kleon</li> <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OVWaVU\">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport</li> <li><a href= \"http://The%20Last%20Lion%20-%20Alone%201934-1940%20-%20Part%201\">The Last Lion - Alone 1934-1940 - Part 1</a> - by William Manchester</li> <li>Author <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yv54CJ\">Vance Havner</a></li> </ul>",
