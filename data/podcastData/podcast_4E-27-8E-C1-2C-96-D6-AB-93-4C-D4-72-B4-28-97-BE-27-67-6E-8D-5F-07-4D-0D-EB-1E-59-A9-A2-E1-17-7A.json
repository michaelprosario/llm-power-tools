    "Description": "<p>Teaching kids to code starts with helping them understand the concepts behind coding before you get into syntax. Aditya Batura, Programmer and Entrepreneur, talks today about the concept of helping every student understand computational thinking.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e262\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e262</a></p> <p>This week I'll be sharing the 7 Pedagogical Shifts That Make Interactive Displays a Key to a Student-Centered Classroom on the Cool Cat Teacher blog sponsored by <a href=\"https://home.smarttech.com/\">SMART Technologies</a>. Shift #1 is that Students are collaborators. My interactive display is the common workspace for the whole class. I use it as a digital workspace, to display any screen for the whole class to see, as a large multi-touch drawing and brainstorming space and so much more. My interactive display is a must-have device. I wouldn't want to teach without one. <a href= \"http://www.inovatio.si/files/content/file/Novice/ED_1705_Filigree_need-for-IFPs_report_EN.pdf\"> Recent research</a> shows that large interactive displays are vital to the classroom ecosystem.</p>",
