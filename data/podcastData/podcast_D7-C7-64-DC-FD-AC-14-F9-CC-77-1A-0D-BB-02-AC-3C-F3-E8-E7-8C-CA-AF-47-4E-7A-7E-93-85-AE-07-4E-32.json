    "Description": "<p>If you&rsquo;re coming to Python from a different language, you may not know about a useful tool for working with loops, Python&rsquo;s built-in enumerate function. This week on the show, David Amos is here, and he has brought another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>Along with the Real Python article covering the details of the enumerate function, we also talk about another article about constructing Python graphical user interface elements in PyQt.</p>\n<p>David shares a couple of resources for data scientists, including an article about skills not taught in data science boot camps, and a project for creating synthetic data.</p>\n<p>We also cover several other articles and projects from the Python community including, an update about youtubedl, hunting for malicious packages on PyPI, using Python&rsquo;s bisect module, 73 examples to help you master f-strings, and game programming in Jupyter notebooks.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/formatting-python-strings/\">Formatting Python Strings</a> </p>\n<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll see two items to add to your Python string formatting toolkit. You&rsquo;ll learn about Python&rsquo;s string format method and the formatted string literal, or f-string. You&rsquo;ll learn about these formatting techniques in detail and add them to your Python string formatting toolkit.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:01:53 &ndash; The youtube-dl Repository Has Been Restored on GitHub With Help From the Electronic Frontier Foundation</li>\n<li>00:04:12 &ndash; Python enumerate(): Simplify Looping With Counters</li>\n<li>00:07:24 &ndash; Hunting for Malicious Packages on PyPI</li>\n<li>00:14:31 &ndash; Sponsor: Scout APM</li>\n<li>00:15:31 &ndash; Using Python&rsquo;s bisect module</li>\n<li>00:19:00 &ndash; 73 Examples to Help You Master Python&rsquo;s f-Strings</li>\n<li>00:21:35 &ndash; 10 Python Skills They Don&rsquo;t Teach in Bootcamp</li>\n<li>00:27:32 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:28:28 &ndash; Python and PyQt: Creating Menus, Toolbars, and Status Bars</li>\n<li>00:33:51 &ndash; SDV: Synthetic Data Generation for Tabular, Relational, Time Series Data</li>\n<li>00:38:19 &ndash; jupylet: Game Programming in Jupyter Notebooks</li>\n<li>00:42:59 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jvbqzc/the_youtubedl_repository_has_been_restored_on/\">The youtube-dl Repository Has Been Restored on GitHub With Help From the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-enumerate/\">Python enumerate(): Simplify Looping With Counters</a> &ndash; Once you learn about for loops in Python, you know that using an index to access items in a sequence isn&rsquo;t very Pythonic. So what do you do when you need that index value? In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn all about Python&rsquo;s built-in enumerate(), where it&rsquo;s used, and how you can emulate its behavior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jordan-wright.com/blog/post/2020-11-12-hunting-for-malicious-packages-on-pypi/\">Hunting for Malicious Packages on PyPI</a> &ndash; Jordan Wright installed every package on PyPI to look for malicious content. And he didn&rsquo;t just inspect code, he actually <em>ran</em> the packages. Brave soul!
