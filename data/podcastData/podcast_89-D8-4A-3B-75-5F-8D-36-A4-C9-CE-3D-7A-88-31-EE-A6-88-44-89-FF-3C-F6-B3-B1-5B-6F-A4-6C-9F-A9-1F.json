    "Description": "<p>Adam Frank, SVP of Product and Marketing at Armory.io, speaks with SE Radio\u2019s <a href= \"https://www.se-radio.net/team/kanchan-shringi/\">Kanchan Shringi</a> about continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment \u2013 and how they differ. Frank suggests that organizations begin by identifying how the CI/CD process aligns best with their unique goals, noting that such goals might be different for B2C versus B2B SAAS (software as a service). They also discuss how the process can differ for monoliths compared to microservices-based products. Finally, they talk about continuous deployment as a service and some unique aspects of Armory\u2019s approach.</p>",
