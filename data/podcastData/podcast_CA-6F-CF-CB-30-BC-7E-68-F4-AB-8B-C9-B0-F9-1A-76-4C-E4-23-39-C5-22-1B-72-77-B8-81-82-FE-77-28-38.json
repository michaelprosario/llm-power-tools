    "Description": "\n        <p>NPUs, AIPC, and Dell\u2019s growing suite of AI products: Shirish Gupta speaks to Jon Krohn about neural processing units and what makes them a go-to tool for AI inference workloads, reasons to move your workloads from the cloud and to your local devices, what the mnemonic AIPC stands for and why it will soon be on everyone\u2019s lips, and he offers a special intro to Dell\u2019s new Pro-AI Studio Toolkit. Hear about several real-world AIPC applications run by Dell\u2019s clients, from detecting manufacturing defects to improving efficiencies for first responders, massively supporting actual life-or-death situations.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Additional materials: <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/877\">www.superdatascience.com/877</a></p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://odsc.com/boston/\">ODSC</a>, <a href=\"https://odsc.com/boston/\">the Open Data Science Conference</a>. </p><p><br></p><p>Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?
