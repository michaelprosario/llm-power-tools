    "Description": "<p>As explained in <a href=\"https://www.storyblok.com/tp/headless-cms-explained\">this piece</a>, \"A <strong>headless CMS</strong> is a back-end only content management system (CMS) built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via a RESTful API or GraphQL API for display on any device.\" Shopify has leaned hard into GraphQL and APIs in general.\u00a0</p><p>The goal, as Coates describes it, is to allow developers to bring their own stack to the front-end, but provide them with the benefits of Shopify's back-end, like edge data processing for improved speed \u00a0at global scale. Shopify also offers a wealth of DevOps tooling and logistical support when it comes to international commerce.\u00a0</p><p>We also discuss <a href=\"https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\">Liquid</a>, the flexible template language Shopify uses for \u00a0building web apps.</p><p>Our lifeboat badge of the week goes to chunhunghan for answering the question: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58463507/how-to-customize-the-switch-button-in-a-flutter/58478926#58478926\">How to customize the switch button in a flutter?</a></p>\n",
