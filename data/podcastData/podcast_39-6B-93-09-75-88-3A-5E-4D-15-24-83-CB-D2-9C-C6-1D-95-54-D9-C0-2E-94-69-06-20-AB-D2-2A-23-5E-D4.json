    "Description": "  BONUS: Building Agile Startups with Nick Hughes of Founders Live <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Welcome, Agile friends! In this episode, I had the pleasure of sitting down with Nick Hughes, the founder of <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.founderslive.com?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolbox_Podcast\">  Founders Live, a global startup community now operating in more than 100 cities and 50 countries</a>. Our conversation explored what it really takes to build a business and how the principles of agility can help entrepreneurs adapt, iterate, and thrive.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  If you\u2019ve ever wondered how to sharpen your message, build resilience in the face of setbacks, and foster meaningful connections in the startup world, this episode is for you!</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   The Birth of Founders Live <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cTest, learn, iterate, and grow. That\u2019s how I built Founders Live.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Nick\u2019s story began over 10 years ago when he noticed something missing in the entrepreneurial world\u2014a supportive community where early-stage founders could connect, learn, and grow together. As a founder himself, he knew firsthand how isolating the startup journey could be.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  He decided to experiment with an idea, and it worked. <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.founderslive.com?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolbox_Podcast\">  Founders Live</a>  has since become a thriving global movement where entrepreneurs pitch their ideas, connect with like-minded people, and celebrate innovation in an engaging, fun atmosphere.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Each <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.founderslive.com?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolbox_Podcast\">  Founders Live</a>  event follows a simple but powerful format: five founders deliver 99-second pitches, followed by four minutes of audience Q&A. Then, the crowd votes on the winner. Add some networking, food, and drinks, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for an unforgettable experience!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  The takeaway here? Test small, see what works, and refine from there.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   The Power of a 99-Second Pitch <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to create your 99-second pitch. But that time frame forces founders to really think: What is my message?\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Nick\u2019s 99-second pitch format is more than a clever gimmick\u2014it\u2019s a forcing function for founders to get crystal clear about their message. In a short window of time, founders must distill their big idea into something precise, engaging, and impactful.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Many founders tell Nick that while it\u2019s nerve-wracking at first, they walk away feeling more confident and impressed with their own ability to communicate under pressure. It\u2019s not just about pitching\u2014it\u2019s about building communication agility and clarity of purpose.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Why Networking and Mentorship Matter <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cIf you figure out ways to help people and open doors for them, it comes back to you tenfold.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  One of the most valuable aspects of Founders Live is its emphasis on connection. Nick shared that many of the most successful founders he knows have built networks by being generous\u2014by \u201copening doors\u201d for others. Whether it\u2019s offering advice, making introductions, or helping someone troubleshoot a challenge, those who give tend to receive tenfold in return.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  His advice for founders? Show up, participate, and look for ways to add value to your community. Authenticity and generosity go a long way in building strong relationships that will support your growth.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Embracing Agility and Resilience <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cAgility is looking at things as experiments\u2014identify what works, keep that, and stop what isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  We also dove into the mindset that helps founders bounce back from setbacks. For Nick, agility means viewing everything as an experiment. When things don\u2019t go as planned, the question isn\u2019t \u201cWhy did this happen to me?\u201d but rather \u201cWhat can I learn from this, and how can I adjust?\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Successful founders are constantly iterating\u2014testing, learning, and evolving. The entrepreneurial journey isn\u2019t a straight line; it\u2019s a cycle of experimentation and improvement. Agility doesn\u2019t just happen in the product\u2014it starts with how you frame your challenges and your willingness to pivot when needed.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Common Misconceptions About Entrepreneurship <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cWe all want creators in the world, but it\u2019s a tough road. You need to build something that adds value before pitching it.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  According to Nick, many first-time founders enter the startup world with unrealistic expectations. Building a business isn\u2019t just about pitching your idea to investors\u2014it\u2019s about creating something valuable, getting traction, and proving adoption first. If you don\u2019t have traction or proof points, you\u2019re burning bridges by pitching too early.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  His advice? Focus on solving real problems and showing early growth before you seek funding. When you walk into the room with evidence that people love your product, your pitch becomes much stronger\u2014and much harder to ignore.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Intrapreneurship: Innovating Inside Larger Companies <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Not every entrepreneur is working outside the corporate world\u2014some are internal innovators looking to make a difference within their organizations. For those intrapreneurs, Nick had some great advice: define your opportunity clearly, understand your company\u2019s risk tolerance, and align your goals with measurable outcomes.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  If you want to pitch new ideas inside a company, start by identifying what success would look like and communicating that vision effectively. Intrapreneurship thrives when there\u2019s clarity around expectations and potential rewards.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   Nick\u2019s Resource Recommendation <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  When I asked Nick for a resource recommendation, he shared the book <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4h65qEu\"> \u201cThe Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life\u201d by David Brooks</a>. It\u2019s an inspiring read about finding purpose and meaning by building something bigger than yourself\u2014a fitting message for entrepreneurs seeking to create meaningful impact.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  We closed with Nick\u2019s final piece of advice: \u201cTest, learn, iterate, and grow. That\u2019s how I built Founders Live.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  This simple but powerful mantra reminds us that agility isn\u2019t just a process\u2014it\u2019s a mindset. Whether you\u2019re launching your own startup or driving innovation within a larger organization, success comes from being open to experimentation and continuous improvement.</p> <p> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  About Nick Hughes</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Nick Hughes is the founder of <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.founderslive.com?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolbox_Podcast\">  Founders Live, a global community and event platform for entrepreneurs</a>, now active in over 100 cities across 50 countries.
