    "SourceUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/se-radio/~3/Fq3Nc538iXY/",
    "Description": "This week, Arno and Markus take a look at error handling at the architectural level. They discuss the different kinds of errors, the groups of people who need to know about them and proven high-level approaches. Later episodes will investigate more technical aspects of error handling, such as idioms for using exceptions or a discussion of checked vs. unchecked exceptions.",
