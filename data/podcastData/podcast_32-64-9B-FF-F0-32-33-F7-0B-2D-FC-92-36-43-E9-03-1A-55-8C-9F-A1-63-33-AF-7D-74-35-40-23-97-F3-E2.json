This team lacked a proper working agreement, which resulted in disengaged team members who didn't participate fully in daily discussions. Dominika\u2019s approach was to help the team start a buddy system for new joiners and ensure that everyone, especially new members, felt heard. She emphasizes the importance of developing a deliberate decision-making model and the need to differentiate between the Definition of Done (DoD) and a team working agreement.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  Is your team\u2019s working agreement fostering participation and inclusion from every member, especially new joiners?
