    "Description": "<p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyanalyzes/'>Emily Walker</a> is a vibrant woman that believes that using color in your wardrobe says a lot about your personal and business brand.\u00a0 For those that can see her picture on the thumbnail or in our social feeds you will better understand what I mean by that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I kicked off the show by asking my guests to describe themself using 5 words.\u00a0 Two of these words she selected were the epitome of her essence. Because she was raised in a challenging home situation, resilience is an important word that she believed saved her from being a negative statistic.\u00a0 As a single parent that lived in Section 8 Housing she had to overcome challenges in life. School was a safe place because of the learning opportunities and establishing friendships. The second she selected was determined.\u00a0 Her belief is that this ties to resilience because she was able to overcome obstacles in her life. She gives more details in the interview and we invite you to hear more about her personal story there.</p>\n<p>Emily is launching a new workshop called the Five Pillars of Personal Branding as part of her signature workshops. Be sure to listen and reach out to her to learn more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
