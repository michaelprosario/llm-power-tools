    "Description": "This episode is about <a href=\"http://www.osgi.org/\">OSGi</a>, the dynamic module system for Java. Our guests are <a href=\"http://www.aqute.biz/Main/HomePage\">Peter Kriens</a> (OSGI's Technical Director) and <a href=\"http://blog.bjhargrave.com/\">BJ Hargrave</a> (OSGI's CTO). We'll discuss what OSGi is all about and why and in which contexts it is useful. Additionally we are having a look at the different layers of OSGI and where and how they are used. Other questions discussed are: What means dynamicity in an OSGI environment? Where is OSGI used? What\u2019s the future of OSGI? How does OSGI interact with existing middleware solutions? How can I run several versions of the same JAR at the same time? Where are OSGI\u2019s problems?",
