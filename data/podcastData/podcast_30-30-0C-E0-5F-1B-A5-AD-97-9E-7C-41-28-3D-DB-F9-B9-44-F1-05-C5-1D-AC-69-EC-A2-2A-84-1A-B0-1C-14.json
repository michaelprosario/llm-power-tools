    "Description": "<p>As a music industry mogul and founder of I.R.S. Records, Miles Copeland prided himself on making deals that were easy to say \u201cyes\u201d to. With a mixture of shrewd business skills, swagger, good taste and great timing, Miles signed or managed some of the most popular bands of the 1980's, including R.E.M., The Go-Go's, and The Police.&nbsp;After getting his start booking little-known British bands in the early 1970's and nearly going bankrupt after a failed tour, Miles eased back into the business by promoting punk groups\u2014who didn\u2019t care that he was broke.&nbsp;He then landed one of the most important deals of his career by convincing A&amp;M Records to take a chance on The Police (whose drummer, Stewart Copeland, was Miles' brother).&nbsp;After I.R.S. dissolved in the mid 1990's, Miles remained a force in entertainment, launching new labels, branching out into world music, and managing Sting\u2019s career until 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
