    "Description": "\n        <p>It\u2019s hard to miss a Slutty Vegan when you\u2019re driving past one.&nbsp;</p><p>No, we\u2019re not talking about a person\u2026 We\u2019re talking about a fast-casual burger chain \u2014 and a vegan one at that!&nbsp;</p><p>Since launching Slutty Vegan in 2017, Pinky has seen her plant-based brand through several iterations: a ghost kitchen, then a food truck, then eventually several brick and mortar locations that continue to pop up across the east coast. And with a valuation of $100 million and expansion into other sectors, Pinky is only getting started...&nbsp;</p><p>This week on <em>How I Built This Lab, </em>Pinky talks with Guy about her journey as a TV producer-turned-restaurateur, and how Slutty Vegan is a prime example of Seth Godin\u2019s Purple Cow theory: companies must build things worth noticing into their products and services. Plus, Pinky reflects on her roots, sharing the valuable lessons about discipline and work ethic that she learned from her parents.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
