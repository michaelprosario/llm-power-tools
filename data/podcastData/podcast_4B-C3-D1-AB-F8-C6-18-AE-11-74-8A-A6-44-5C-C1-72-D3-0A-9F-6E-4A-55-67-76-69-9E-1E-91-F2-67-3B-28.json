    "Description": "<p>Azure Stack is coming soon! While at the Build conference in Seattle, Richard sat down with Jeffrey Snover to dig into the latest developments around Azure Stack. If you like cloud architecture but are not prepared to go to the public cloud, Azure Stack offers many of the capabilities of Azure but in a private configuration. Jeffrey talks about the various scenarios that make sense for Azure Stack and how it is likely to be made available through a number of third party providers. Azure Stack will be in GA mid-2017 and the features will just keep coming!</p>\n",
