    "SourceUrl": "https://www.runasradio.com/",
    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Venkat Kalyanasundaram about using IPv6 in your internal networks. Since Vista, IPv6 has been on by default on all versions of Windows. Should you leave it on? What breaks if you turn it off? What is the overhead of leaving it on? Venkat discusses all of these issues, as well as the advantages of using IPv6. We aren't likely to be running in a pure IPv6 world any time soon, but you can start using IPv6 internally today!</p>\n",
