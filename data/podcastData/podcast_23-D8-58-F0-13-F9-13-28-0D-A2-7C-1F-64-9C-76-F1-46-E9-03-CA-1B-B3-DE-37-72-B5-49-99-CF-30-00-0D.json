    "Description": "<p>The mystery and miracle of flight sparked <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kontsevoy/\">Ev Kontsevoy\u2019s</a> interest in engineering as a child growing up in the Soviet Union.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a kid, when I saw like airplane flying over, I was having a really hard time not stopping and staring at it until it's gone,\u201d said Kontsevoy, co-founder and CEO of Teleport, said in this episode of the Tech Founders Odyssey podcast series. \u201cI really wanted to figure out how to make it fly.\u201d</p><p>Inevitably, he said, the engineering path led him to computers, where he was thrilled by the power he could wield through programming. \u201cYou're a teenager, no one really listens to you yet, but you tell a computer to go print number 10 ... and then you say, do it a million times. And the stupid computer just prints 10 million. You feel like a magician that just bends like machines to your will.\u201d</p><p>In this episode of the series, part of The New Stack Makers podcast, Kontsevoy discussed his journey to co-founding Teleport, an infrastructure access platform, with TNS co-hosts <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/colleen/\">Colleen Coll</a> and <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/hjoslyn/\">Heather Joslyn.</a></p>\n",
