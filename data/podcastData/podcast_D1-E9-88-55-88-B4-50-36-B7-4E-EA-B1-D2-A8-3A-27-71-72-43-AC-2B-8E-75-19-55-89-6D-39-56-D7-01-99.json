    "Description": "<p>This is <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-just-in-time-jit-compilers/\">a great crash course</a> on just-in-time compilers written by Lin Clark, who works in advanced development at Mozilla on Rust and Web Assembly. It references the film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFMo3UJ4B4g\">Arrival</a> and kicked off our discussion on the podcast.\u00a0</p><p>Paul talks about his first love, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT#:~:text=XSLT%20(Extensible%20Stylesheet%20Language%20Transformations,as%20PDF%2C%20PostScript%20and%20PNG.\">XSLT</a>, and how that language actually foreshadowed a lot of what would become popular staples of modern programming languages.\u00a0</p><p>Sara and Paul share their thoughts on what it takes to craft a new language as a programmer and why they have never embarked on this arduous intellectual adventure.\u00a0</p><p>This brought to mind a <a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/133\">well written essay</a> from one of the creators of Redis, who is stepping back from managing the project to work on something new. Here is, in my opinion, a profound quote from that piece:\u00a0</p><p>\"I write code in order to express myself, and I consider what I code an artifact, rather than just something useful to get things done. I would say that what I write is useful just as a side effect, but my first goal is to make something that is, in some way, beautiful. In essence, I would rather be remembered as a bad artist than a good programmer.\"</p><p>Our lifeboat badge of the week goes to Farhan Amjad, who answered the question - <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388071/how-can-i-implement-pageview-in-swiftui/58396319#58396319\">How can I implement PageView in SwiftUI?</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
