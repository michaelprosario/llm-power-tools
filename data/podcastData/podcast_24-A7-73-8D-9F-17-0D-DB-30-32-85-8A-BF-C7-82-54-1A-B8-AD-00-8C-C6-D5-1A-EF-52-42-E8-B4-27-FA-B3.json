    "Description": "<p>We\u2019re back with another session from ELC Annual 2024! This episode features an engaging session on collaboration & innovation in the time of AI with Anurag Agarwal, VPE, Google Workspace @ Google, and Lizzie Matusov, Co-Founder & CEO @ Quotient! In this conversation, they dissect how AI is transforming not only the products engineering teams are building but also how teams work together internally. They cover how Google / Google Workplace specifically use AI both internally & externally, strategies for creating & maintaining alignment across a large org, how Anurag addressed challenges during this transitional period, and more.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anurag-agarwal-3829a210\"><strong>ANURAG AGARWAL</strong></a></h2><p>Anurag Agarwal leads the Google Workspace engineering organization, overseeing products such as Gmail, Calendar, Chat, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet that help billions of users and customers across the world to connect, create and build together.</p><p>With over 18 years of experience at Google, Anurag\u2019s expertise spans a wide range of consumer and enterprise products and technologies.

It's not about the individual tools, it's really about the whole together.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Anurag Agarwal \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizzie-matusov/\"><strong>LIZZIE MATUSOV</strong></a></h2><p>Lizzie Matusov is the co-founder and CEO of Quotient, a developer tool that surfaces the friction slowing down engineering teams and resolves it directly.
