    "Description": "<p>In 2016, Fawn Weaver became fixated on a New York Times article telling the little-known story of Nearest Green, a formerly enslaved man who taught Jack Daniel\u2014yes,&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>Jack Daniel\u2014how to make Tennessee whiskey.</p><p>&nbsp;After diving deeper into the story, Fawn ended up purchasing the farm in Lynchburg, Tennessee where Nearest had taught Jack how to distill; and she began meeting the descendants of both men. She eventually decided the best way to preserve Nearest\u2019s legacy was with a bottle of the best Tennessee whiskey she could make.</p><p>&nbsp;With no background in distilling, she threw herself into the insular world of spirit-making, an industry mostly dominated by white men. In the eight years since Fawn first discovered his story, Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey has become one of the fastest-growing whiskey brands in the world, and one of the most awarded American whiskeys.</p><p><br></p><p><em>This episode of How I Built This was produced by Liz Metzger and edited by Neva Grant.
