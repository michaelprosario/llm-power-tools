    "Description": "<p>In a conversation on The New Stack Makers, co-hosted by Alex Williams, TNS founder and publisher, and Charles Humble, an industry expert who served as a software engineer, architect and CTO and now podcaster, author and consultant at Conissaunce Ltd., discussed why software developers and engineers should care about their impact on climate change. Humble emphasized that building software sustainably starts with better operations, leading to cost savings and improved security. He cited past successes in combating environmental issues like acid rain and the ozone hole through international agreements and emissions reduction strategies.</p><p>Despite modest growth since 2010, data centers remain significant electricity consumers, comparable to countries like Brazil. The power-intensive nature of AI models exacerbates these challenges and may lead to scarcity issues. Humble mentioned the Green Software Foundation's Maturity Matrix with goals for carbon-free data centers and longer device lifespans, discussing their validity and the role of regulation in achieving them. Overall, software development's environmental impact, primarily carbon emissions, necessitates proactive measures and industry-wide collaboration.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about sustainability:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/what-is-greenops-putting-a-sustainable-focus-on-finops/ \">What is GreenOps?
