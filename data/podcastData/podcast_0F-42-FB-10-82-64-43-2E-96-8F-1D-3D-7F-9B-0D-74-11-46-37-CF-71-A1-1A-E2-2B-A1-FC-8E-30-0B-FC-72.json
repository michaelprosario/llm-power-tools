    "Description": "<p>We speak with Robert Lange!</p>\n<p>Robert is a PhD student at the Technical University Berlin. His research combines Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Cognitive Science to study the learning dynamics of large collectives. He has a brilliant blog where he distils and explains cutting edge ML research. We spoke about his story, economics, multi-agent RL, intelligence and AGI, and his recent article summarising the state of the art in neural network pruning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Robert's article on pruning in NNs https://roberttlange.github.io/posts/2020/06/lottery-ticket-hypothesis/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:00 Intro</p>\n<p>00:04:17 Show start and intro to Robert</p>\n<p>00:11:39 Economics background&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:27:20 Intrinsic motivation&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:33:22 Intelligence/consciousness</p>\n<p>00:48:16 Lottery ticket/pruning article discussion</p>\n<p>01:43:21 Robert's advice for younger self and state of deep learning</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Robert's LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-tjarko-lange-19539a12a/</p>\n<p>@RobertTLange</p>\n<p>#machinelearning #deeplearning</p>\n",
