The discussion was particularly interesting due to its timing, as it followed the recent release of the EU&#39;s proposed AI Act, which could potentially ban American companies like OpenAI and Google from providing API access to generative AI models and impose massive fines for non-compliance.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The speakers openly addressed potential risks of AI technology and emphasized the need for precision regulation. This was a unique approach, as historically, US companies have tried their hardest to avoid regulation. The hearing not only showcased the willingness of industry leaders to engage in discussions on regulation but also demonstrated the need for a balanced approach to avoid stifling innovation.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The EU AI Act, scheduled to come into power in 2026, is still just a proposal, but it has already raised concerns about its impact on the American tech ecosystem and potential conflicts between US and EU laws. With extraterritorial jurisdiction and provisions targeting open-source developers and software distributors like GitHub, the Act could create more problems than it solves by encouraging unsafe AI practices and limiting access to advanced AI technologies.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>One core issue with the Act is the designation of foundation models in the highest risk category, primarily due to their open-ended nature. A significant risk theme revolves around users creating harmful content and determining who should be held accountable \u2013 the users or the platforms. The Senate hearing served as an essential platform to discuss these pressing concerns and work towards a regulatory framework that promotes both safety and innovation in AI.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00 Show</p>\n<p>01:35 Legals</p>\n<p>03:44 Intro </p>\n<p>10:33 Altman intro</p>\n<p>14:16 Christina Montgomery</p>\n<p>18:20 Gary Marcus</p>\n<p>23:15 Jobs</p>\n<p>26:01 Scorecards</p>\n<p>28:08 Harmful content </p>\n<p>29:47 Startups</p>\n<p>31:35 What meets the definition of harmful?</p>\n<p>32:08 Moratorium</p>\n<p>36:11 Social Media</p>\n<p>46:17 Gary&#39;s take on BingGPT and pivot into policy</p>\n<p>48:05 Democratisation</p>\n",
