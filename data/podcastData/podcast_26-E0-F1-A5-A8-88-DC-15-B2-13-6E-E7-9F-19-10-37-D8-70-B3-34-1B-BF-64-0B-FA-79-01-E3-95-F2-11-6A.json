    "Description": "<p>Given the vulnerability of so many systems, it\u2019s not surprising that <a href=\"https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/ddos-threat-landscape-report-2023/\">cyberattacks on applications and APIs increased 82% in 2022</a> compared to the previous year, according to a report released this year by <a href=\"https://www.imperva.com/?utm_content=inline-mention\" target=\"_blank\">Imperva\u2019s</a> global threat researchers.</p><p>What might rattle even the most experienced technologists is the sheer scale of those attacks. Digging into the data, Imperva, an application and data security company, found that the largest layer seven, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack it mitigated during 2022 involved \u2014 you might want to sit down for this \u2014 more than 3.9 million API requests per second.</p><p>\u201cMost developers, when they think about their <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/what-devs-must-know-about-apis-before-designing-and-using-them/\">APIs,</a> they\u2019re usually dealing with traffic that\u2019s maybe 1,000 requests per second, not too much more than that. Twenty thousand, for a larger API,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-klimek-37588962\">Peter Klimek, </a>director of technology at Imperva, in this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast. \u201cSo, to get to 3.9 million, it\u2019s really staggering.\u201d</p><p>Klimek spoke to <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/hjoslyn/\">Heather Joslyn</a> of TNS about the special challenges of APIs and <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/security/\">cybersecurity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/white-papers/improve-api-performance-with-a-sound-api-security-strategy/\">steps organizations can take to keep their APIs safe.</a></p><p>The episode was sponsored by Imperva.</p>\n",
