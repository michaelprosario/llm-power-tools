So when you make that case to other leaders, especially outside of engineering, I think it's important that...</p><p>\u2018Hey, we're not going for this ideal world of no technical debt. It's just that here's the impact of not focusing on it. The impact of not focusing on this technical debt is that we are going to see outages and there will be this false sense of progress because every time the engineers try to focus on some product work, they're going to have to go on this outage and solve that.\u2019</p><p>I think the best way to put it really is you are treading water at that point.\u201d</p><p>- Surabhi Gupta\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Check out our friends and sponsor,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/sfelc/Jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a>.
