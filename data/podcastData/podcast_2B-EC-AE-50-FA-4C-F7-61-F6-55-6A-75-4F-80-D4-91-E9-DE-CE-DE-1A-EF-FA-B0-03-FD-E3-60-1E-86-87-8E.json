    "Description": "<p>Over the past five to ten years, the testing of microservices has seen significant growth. This surge in testing can be attributed to the increasing adoption of microservices and Kubernetes, which signify a shift away from monolithic application architectures. Bruno Lopes, a leader at Kubernetes company incubator Kubeshop, noted this trend. Kubeshop has initiated six Kubernetes projects, including TestKube, a Kubernetes native testing framework led by Lopes.</p><p>This rise in testing is making it more accessible to a wider audience and is enhancing the developer experience through automation. Developers now have more time to focus on innovation rather than manual testing. However, there is often a disconnect between development and testing, as developers move quickly, outpacing organizational adaptation to modern testing methods.</p><p>Lopes emphasized the importance of testing before production deployment and advocated for creating production-resembling testing environments that allow for rapid deployment without waiting for manual tests. This approach is particularly critical for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams who need to respond quickly to issues and minimize downtime for customers. In some cases, it's necessary to run tests within Kubernetes itself, a concept that may take time for companies to fully embrace as the developer experience continues to improve.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Kubernetes, Testing and TestKube:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/testkube-cloud-native-testing-framework-for-kubernetes/\">Testkube: A Cloud Native Testing Framework for Kubernetes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/top-5-challenges-in-modern-kubernetes-testing/\">Top 5 Challenges in Modern Kubernetes Testing</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/why-you-should-start-testing-in-the-cloud-native-way/\">Why You Should Start Testing in the Cloud Native Way</a></p>\n",
