    "Description": "<p>One of the hidden gems this year at the PDC conference was the Microsoft Research section. It was buried in the back of the convention center, unfortunately, so a lot of people didn't know it was there. Scott talks to each team at length and gets the scoop on what project are coming to an IDE near you sometime soon.</p>\n",
