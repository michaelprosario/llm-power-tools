    "Description": "<p>How does your organization respond to incidents? While at NDC Porto, Richard chatted with Mandi Walls about her experiences with different incidents, from corrupted files to data center failures. Mandi talks about detecting and determining the scope of an incident, whether it is specific to a customer (or group of customers), or possibly system wide. The conversation ranges over external attacks, bad software updates, unique configuration problems, and more. Keeping good records during the incident helps clean up after the event and provides for an effective retrospective.</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.pagerduty.com/\">PagerDuty</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 17, 2024</p>\n",
