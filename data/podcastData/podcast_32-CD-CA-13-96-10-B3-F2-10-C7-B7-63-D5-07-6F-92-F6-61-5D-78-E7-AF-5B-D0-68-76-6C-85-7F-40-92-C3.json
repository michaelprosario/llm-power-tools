    "Description": "<p>YT version: https://youtu.be/DxBZORM9F-8</p>\n<p>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mlst&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/ESrGqhf5CB</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Prof. Ken Stanley argued in his book that our world has become saturated with objectives. The process of setting an objective, attempting to achieve it, and measuring progress along the way has become the primary route to achievement in our culture. He\u2019s not saying that objectives are bad per se, especially if they\u2019re modest, but he thinks that when goals are ambitious then the search space becomes deceptive.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Is the key to artificial intelligence really related to intelligence? Does taking a job with a higher salary really bring you closer to being a millionaire? The problem is that the stepping stones which lead to ambitious objectives tend to be pretty strange, they don't resemble the final end state at all. Vaccum tubes led to computers for example and Youtube started as a dating website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>What fascinated us about this conversation with Ken is that we got a much deeper understanding of his philosophy. He lead by saying that he thought it's worth questioning whether artificial intelligence is even a science or not. Ken thinks that the secret to future progress is for us to embrace more subjectivity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>[00:00:00] Tim Intro</p>\n<p>[00:12:54] Intro</p>\n<p>[00:17:08] Seeing ideas everywhere - AI and art are highly connected</p>\n<p>[00:28:40] Creativity in Mathematics</p>\n<p>[00:30:14] Where is the intelligence in art?</p>\n<p>[00:38:49] Is AI disappointingly simple to mechanise?</p>\n<p>[00:42:48] Slightly conscious</p>\n<p>[00:46:27] Do we have subjective experience?</p>\n<p>[00:50:23] Fear of the unknown</p>\n<p>[00:51:48] Free Will</p>\n<p>[00:54:22] Chalmers</p>\n<p>[00:55:08] What's happening now in open-endedness</p>\n<p>[00:58:31] Generalisation</p>\n<p>[01:06:34] Representation primitives and what it means to understand</p>\n<p>[01:12:37] Appeal to definitions, knowledge itself blocks discovery</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Make sure you buy Kenneth's book!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective [Stanley, Lehman]</p>\n<p>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Abandoning Objectives: Evolution through the</p>\n<p>Search for Novelty Alone [Lehman, Stanley]</p>\n<p>https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/DevelopmentalRobotics/lehman_ecj11.pdf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/kenneth0stanley</p>\n",
