    "SourceUrl": "https://www.runasradio.com/",
    "Description": "<p>Is the deployment of IPv6 impacted by the pandemic? Richard talks to Ed Horley about how IPv6 deployment has continued through the crisis - and also how enterprises continue to lag behind home services when it comes to IPv6! Ed discusses the latest data around IPv6 usages showing that work-from-home has actually increased the amount of IPv6 traffic because the majority of consumer ISPs now provide IPv6 services. This leads to an interesting discussion on the instrumentation of IPv6 traffic for business. If you're not using IPv6 in your work network, you likely aren't watching what traffic moves across it!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.crisisservicescanada.ca/en/\">Crisis Services Canada</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781430263708\">Practical IPv6 for Windows Administrators</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ipv6-fundamentals-a-straightforward-approach-to-understanding-9781587144776\">IPv6 Fundamentals 2nd Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"https://packetpushers.net/series/ipv6-buzz/\">IPv6 Buzz</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.worldipv6launch.org/measurements/\">IPv6 Deployment Stats</a></li></ul>\n",
