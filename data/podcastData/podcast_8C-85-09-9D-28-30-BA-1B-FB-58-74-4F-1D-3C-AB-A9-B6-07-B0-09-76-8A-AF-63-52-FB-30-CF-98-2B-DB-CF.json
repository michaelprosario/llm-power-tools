    "Description": "<p>Richard and Greg talk to Buck Woody about SQL CMS, a tool he's contributed to codeplex at http://sqlcms.codeplex.com. SQL CMS is actually a collection of tools that together provide content management of SQL Server and other servers in your network, allowing you to identify different servers, who's responsible for managing them, their current status and details of their configuration. It's a great synergy of tools built into SQL Server 2008, accelerators like MAPS and EPM - Enterprise Policy Management Framework, another project on codeplex.</p>\n",
