    "Description": "  BONUS: How to create psychological safety at work with Mehmet Baha <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  In this BONUS episode, we talk about the essential elements of creating <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/psychological-safety/\"> psychological safety</a>  at work with Mehmet Baha, one of Facebook's first European employees and a renowned psychological safety expert. Drawing from his extensive experience and new book, Baha shares practical tools, inspiring examples, and thought-provoking insights that can help transform workplace culture.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  This episode builds on Mehmet\u2019s guest blog post on the concepts we discuss. You can find <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2025/02/uncategorized/how-facebook-scaled-psychological-safety-mehmet-baha-shares-their-journey/\">  Baha\u2019s guest blog post on psychological safety here</a>.\u00a0</p>   The Power of the 16-32-64 Framework <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  The conversation begins with Baha introducing his innovative \"16-32-64\" framework, a comprehensive approach that combines head (cognition), heart (emotion), and hands (practice). This framework provides 16 inspiring examples, 32 practical tools, and 64 questions designed to foster psychological safety in the workplace. Baha explains how this interactive approach encourages readers to reflect and take action, emphasizing the importance of collaboration with professionals worldwide in developing these thought-provoking questions.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \"When I was writing the book, I thought about how I could make this interactive. How can I make readers take action? So, I realized that questions are a powerful tool to help readers to reflect and take these ideas into action.\"</p>   Debunking Psychological Safety Myths <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Baha addresses three major misconceptions about psychological safety that often hinder organizational progress. He emphasizes that psychological safety isn't just about being nice or avoiding difficult conversations, nor is it solely about encouraging conflict. Through real-world examples, including a compelling story about a mining company leader who transformed workplace safety through psychological safety principles, Baha demonstrates how this approach can drive tangible business results.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \"According to research, when employees feel that their opinions count, we see happiness, reduction in turnover and more productivity.\"</p>   Practical Tools for Immediate Implementation <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  The discussion explores two powerful tools from Baha's collection of 32 practical approaches. The first tool, \"Movers, Movables, Immovables,\" (from Jason Little\u2019s <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4jZUniv\"> Lean Change Management</a>) helps leaders navigate resistance to change by identifying different employee groups and focusing on achievable wins. The second tool, the \"Green Card\" technique, demonstrates how one director successfully transformed a silent team into an engaged workforce by explicitly encouraging dissent.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \"Don't spend so much of our time with resistance. Find the movers, and find the small-wins.\"</p> <p>\u00a0</p>   The Journey of Self-Reflection <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Baha emphasizes the critical role of self-reflection in developing psychological safety. He outlines a progression from awareness to action, stressing that leadership transformation begins with self-awareness and requires consistent application of knowledge.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \"Everything in life starts from within. Without leading ourselves, we can't lead others.\"</p>   Recommended Reading For Further Study <ul style= \"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\"> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> Baha\u2019s Guest Blog Post: https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2025/02/uncategorized/how-facebook-scaled-psychological-safety-mehmet-baha-shares-their-journey/</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> Baha\u2019s Book: \"<a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3EEP9si\">Creating Psychological Safety at Work</a>: The Essential Guide to Boosting Team Performance\" by Mehmet Baha (Available on Amazon)</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\" style= \"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" role= \"presentation\"> Free Resources: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://solutionfolder.com/free-resources?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolboxPodcast\">  solutionfolder.com/free-resources</a>  - access video series on psychological safety</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  About Mehmet Baha</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Mehmet Baha is a psychological safety expert and one of Facebook's first European employees, with over 24 years of experience working with top organizations.
