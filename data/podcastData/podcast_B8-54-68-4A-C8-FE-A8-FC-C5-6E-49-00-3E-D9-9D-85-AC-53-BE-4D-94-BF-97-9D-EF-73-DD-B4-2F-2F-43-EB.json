    "Description": "<p>Donn's on a roll again this week and talks to us about his experience having developed Android for a while. In the early days of Android development, as app developers we felt like we had a decent grasp of everything you needed to know to pump out decent apps.</p>\n<p>But with the time, and the latest updates, that has become a tricky thing.
