    "Description": "<p>Vuori founder Joe Kudla built a 4-billion-dollar company on a risky idea: that men actually cared about the clothes they worked out in. When Joe launched Vuori in 2015, women\u2019s athleisure brands like Lululemon were exploding, but there wasn\u2019t a similar brand that catered to men. So Joe set out to sell men\u2019s workout clothes that didn\u2019t scream \u201chey, these are workout clothes!\u201d and tried to place them into yoga studios and other small stores. At first Vuori didn\u2019t get much traction \u2013 so Joe made a quick pivot to DTC, soon learning that men were more likely to buy activewear if it worked for everything: yoga, running, hiking, or just hanging out. After risking its dwindling cash on a major marketing campaign, Vuori hit its stride, becoming profitable within two years after launch.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Rommel Wood, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Alex Cheng.</p><p>Our engineers were Gilly Moon and Josh Newell.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter</em></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em></a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
