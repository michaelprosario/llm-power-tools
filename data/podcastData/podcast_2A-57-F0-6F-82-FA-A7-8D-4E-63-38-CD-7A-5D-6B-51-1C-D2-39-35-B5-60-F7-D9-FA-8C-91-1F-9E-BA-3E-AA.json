    "Description": "<p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers from KubeCon EU 2023, Rob Barnes, a senior developer advocate at HashiCorp, discusses how their networking service, Consul, allows users to incorporate containers or virtual machines into their workflows without imposing container usage. Consul, an early implementation of service mesh technology, offers a full-featured control plane with service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionalities. It supports various environments, including traditional applications, VMs, containers, and orchestration engines like Nomad and Kubernetes.</p><p>Barnes explains that Consul can dictate which services can communicate with each other based on rules. By leveraging these capabilities, HashiCorp aims to make users' lives easier and software more secure.</p><p>Barnes emphasizes that there are misconceptions about service mesh, with some assuming it is exclusively tied to container usage. He clarifies that service mesh adoption should be flexible and meet users wherever they are in their technology stack. The future of service mesh lies in educating people about its role within the broader context and addressing any knowledge gaps.</p><p>Join Rob Barnes and our host, Alex Williams, in exploring the evolving landscape of service mesh and understanding how it can enhance workflows.</p><p>Find out more about HashiCorp or the biggest news from KubeCon on The New Stack:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/hashicorp-vault-operator-manages-kubernetes-secrets/\" target=\"_blank\">HashiCorp Vault Operator Manages Kubernetes Secrets</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-hashicorp-does-site-reliability-engineering/\" target=\"_blank\">How HashiCorp Does Site Reliability Engineering</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/a-boring-kubernetes-release/\" target=\"_blank\">A Boring Kubernetes Release</a></p>\n",
