    "Description": "<p>Falco, an open-source runtime observability and security tool, was created by Sysdig founder Loris Degioanni to collect real-time system events directly from the kernel. Leveraging eBPF technology for improved safety and performance, Falco gathers data like pod names and namespaces, correlating them with customizable rules. Unlike static analysis tools, it operates in real-time, monitoring events as they occur. In this episode of The New Stack Makers, TNS Editor-in-Chief, Heather Joslyn spoke with Thomas Labarussias, Senior Developer Advocate at Sysdig,\u00a0Leonardo Grasso, Open Source Tech Lead Manager at Sysdig\u00a0and Luca Guerra,\u00a0Sr. Open Source Engineer at Sysdig to get the latest update on Falco.\u00a0</p><p>Graduating from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in February 2023 after entering its sandbox six years prior, Falco\u2019s maintainers have focused on technical maturity and broad usability. This includes simplifying installations across diverse environments, thanks in part to advancements from the Linux Foundation.</p><p>Looking ahead, the team is enhancing core functionalities, including more customizable rules and alert formats. A key innovation is Falco Talon, introduced in September 2023, which provides a no-code response engine to link alerts with real-time remediation actions. Talon addresses a longstanding gap in automating responses within the Falco ecosystem, advancing its capabilities for runtime security.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Falco:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/falco-is-a-cncf-graduate-now-what/\">Falco Is a CNCF Graduate.
