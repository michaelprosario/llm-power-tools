    "Description": "\n        <p>Doug Hirsch, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of GoodRx, isn\u2019t afraid to tackle really complex problems, but he\u2019s the first to admit that he doesn\u2019t have all the answers. His solution? Focusing on what he\u2019s good at and then surrounding himself with really smart people who can handle the rest. It\u2019s that kind of strategic thinking that has made GoodRx a runaway success, helping people save over $9 billion in prescription drug expenses since its launch in 2011. Tune in as Doug shares his motivation for bringing transparency to healthcare pricing, the lessons he\u2019s learned along the way, and his advice for entrepreneurs everywhere.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/blog/podcast?int_cmpgn=no_campaign&amp;int_dept=entreleadership_bu&amp;int_lctn=Blog-Right_Column&amp;int_fmt=text&amp;int_dscpn=entreleadership_podcast_link_in_player\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2YvGOx7\">GoodRx website</a></p> <p>We want your opinion!\u00a0<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2LC2CDR\">Review this episode.</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
