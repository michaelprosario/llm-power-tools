    "Description": "<p>Karen Voglesang @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/NBCTchr\">NBCTchr</a> uses thinking routines in her classroom. After participating in Harvard's Project Zero, she is applying and using the methods in classrooms and with teachers. Learn some thinking routines and how to apply these valuable techniques in your classroom. <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e134%20\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e134</a></p> <p>Today's sponsor is <a href= \"http://coolcatteacher.com/discover\">Kids Discover</a>. They're doing awesome things to drive inquiry based learning. Check out <a href= \"http://coolcatteacher.com/discover\">coolcatteacher.com/discover</a> and see how the Kids Discover online platform lets students enter discovery mode. This fun, visual tool lets students explore 150 different science and social studies units for elementary and middle school learners. And while they can explore a wide variety of topics from the US Constitution to Ecology and Ancient China, I also like that you can assign these nonfiction texts and three different lexiles to supplement what you're doing in the classroom.
