So months later, she signed up for a coding program, and her son ended up as her teacher\u2019s assistant. Lorraine and Bobby talk about what it\u2019s like to watch each other grow as coders, how learning to code has affected their relationship, and what they\u2019ve learned so far as junior developers.
