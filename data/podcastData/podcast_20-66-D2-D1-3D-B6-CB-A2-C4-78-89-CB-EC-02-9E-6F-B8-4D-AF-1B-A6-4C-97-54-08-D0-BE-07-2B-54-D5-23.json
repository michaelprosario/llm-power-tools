    "Description": "<p>Today is AI Literacy Day, Friday, March 28, 2025. So, as my part in celebrating this day, I thought the best people to speak about this topic is my students. So, I issued a call to my AP students and two of them showed up this past Tuesday and we recorded this show. I think that their honest, intelligent, reflective thoughts of the issue of their generation and their concerns and hopes for the future. If you didn't want to talk to your students about Artificial Intelligence, you will after this show. I'm going to watch this with my other classes to start the conversation. The boldness and honesty shines through and I know I'm biased, but I'm just so, so proud of them! Way to go Will and Lucy. Thanks for speaking out!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Get the full show notes at <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/ailiteracyday2025\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/ailiteracyday2025</a>\u00a0</p>",
