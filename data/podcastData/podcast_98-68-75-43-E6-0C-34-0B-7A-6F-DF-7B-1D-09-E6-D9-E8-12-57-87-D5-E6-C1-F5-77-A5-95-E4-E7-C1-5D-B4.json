    "Description": "<p>We cover building community & digital transformation with Yvette Pasqua, CTO @ Exos! She shares her leadership journey from MeetUp to Exos and how her experiences shaped her views on the importance of community and effective networking. We also discuss principles for creating authentic meetup experiences, how Yvette navigated her Head of Eng search without a recruiter, the importance of asking others for help, and how Exos navigated the opportunities & challenges through their digital transformation.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ypasqua/\">YVETTE PASQUA</a></h2><p>Yvette (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lolarobot\">@lolarobot</a>) is the CTO of <a href=\"https://www.teamexos.com/\">Exos</a> where she leads the product and engineering teams with a focus on continuous improvement, iteration, and using data to launch products that help our members become healthier and achieve their wellness, life, and work goals.</p><p>Prior to joining Exos, Yvette led Product and Engineering at Haven, a health tech startup, and was the CTO at Meetup. Yvette\u2019s career has included leadership roles at startups and product development firms building products like Grindr and the Olympics video player.

Do you have any advice? What have you thought of are the best characteristics for someone in that role?\u201d</p><p>It's a long-term play, but I think the important thing is to be really upfront with your intention for the chat. And to deliver on that in an authentic way. And to not BS someone and say, \u2018Hey, I wanna network!\u2019 And then throw a job in their face and a job description.</p><p>-Yvette Pasqua</p></blockquote><h2>Interested in joining an <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">ELC Peer Group?</a></h2><p>ELCs <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">Peer Groups</a> provide a virtual, curated, and ongoing peer learning opportunity to help you navigate the unknown, uncover solutions and accelerate your learning with a small group of trusted peers.</p><p><strong>Apply to join a peer group HERE:</strong> <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\"><strong>sfelc.com/peerGroups</strong></a></p><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Building technology with community in mind at MeetUp and Exos (2:20) (0:07)</li><li>How community and in-person experiences inspire Yvette\u2019s career decisions (5:40)</li><li>What Yvette learned about networking / community building from MeetUp (7:10)</li><li>Principles for creating meaningful, authentic gatherings (10:54)</li><li>Why setting boundaries & expectations encourages group psychological safety (12:38)</li><li>How Yvette successfully navigated her Head of Eng search without a recruiter (14:32)</li><li>Strategies for targeting potential hires that you haven\u2019t met before (17:40)</li><li>Ask others for advice (21:31)</li><li>Tactics for reaching out to people in an authentic way (23:40)</li><li>Prioritizing time for networking conversations (27:55)</li><li>Behind the digital transformation at Exos from a primarily coaching model (32:37)</li><li>How Exos continuously models growth mindset (37:42)</li><li>When digital transformation reaches a turning point (39:44)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (42:38)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/\">The Pragmatic Engineer</a> by Gergely Orosz (blog/newsletter) - The #1 technology newsletter\u00a0<a href=\"https://substack.com/discover/category/technology/paid\">on Substack</a>.
