    "Description": "\n        <p>We\u2019re wrapping up our special bonus content from EntreLeadership Summit with a powerful lesson from Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly on leading his team through the airline\u2019s recent tragedy in April. He offers tremendous insight on the importance of communication and teamwork\u2014and it\u2019s a testimony you\u2019ll likely never forget. Next, a few members of Ramsey Solutions operating board of directors answer questions from our attendees, with topics ranging from core values to the origin of Summit itself. We\u2019ll also hear from Will Moyers, CEO of Vallus Energy Consulting, who came to Summit to celebrate the EntreLeadership-driven transformation of his now debt-free business. And last but not least, Sarah Sloyan, EntreLeadership Vice President, joins us to recap some of her favorite moments from an incredible three days in San Antonio.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/posts?view=tile&amp;format=podcast&amp;action=index&amp;controller=podcasts\"> entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/summit2019\">EntreLeadership Summit 2019</a></p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
