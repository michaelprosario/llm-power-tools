    "Description": "\n        <p>Ok, not everyone can (or wants to!) go live in a monastery like self-made billionaire entrepreneur Jesse Itzler did, but we can all certainly reap the benefits of the powerful lessons he learned while there. Removed from the endless distractions of his daily life, Jesse quickly realized that he was losing one of his greatest skills: thinking. If you too aren\u2019t regularly spending time in thought, consider yourself warned. You\u2019re headed straight toward burnout.
