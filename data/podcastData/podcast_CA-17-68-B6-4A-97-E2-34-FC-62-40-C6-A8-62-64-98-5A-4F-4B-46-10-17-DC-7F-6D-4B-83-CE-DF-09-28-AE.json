    "Description": "<p>SharePoint has never been more manageable! Richard chats with Andrew Connell about his experiences around using the latest programming models for SharePoint and how they stick to more standardized client-side development models that are easier to secure, audit and don't mess with your servers quite so much. The conversation starts out with a discussion around the Office 365 APIs and the programmability they bring to Office 365 as a whole, while also sticking to good secure standards - this is the stuff that Microsoft itself depends on! Andrew talks about how the cloud-first approach to SharePoint has strengthened and simplified SharePoint on-premises, so we all benefit!</p>\n",
