    "Description": "<p>Are you ready for M365 Copilot? Richard talks with Karoliina Kettukari about what we can expect from M365 Copilot and how you can help your organization prepare for it. Karoliina discusses the more straightforward aspects of M365 Copilot we can expect, such as taking advantage of more of the features in the Office suite of products like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The situation is more interesting when considering how Copilot could surface information from within your organization. Now you need to be thorough about identifying sensitive information and data governance as a whole. Plenty of policy and training is needed around these tools, but the benefits could be huge!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2023/03/16/copilot-in-viva-sales-available-as-thousands-of-customers-adopt-next-generation-ai-in-dynamics-365-copilot-and-power-platform/\">Microsoft Copilot Sales</a></li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-delve-1315665a-c6af-4409-a28d-49f8916878ca\">Office Delve</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaboration-governance-overview?view=o365-worldwide\">Collaboration Governance</a></li></ul><p>Recorded August 8, 2023</p>\n",
