    "Title": "Should managers of developers ever make technical decisions?",
    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>To start things off, we talk about the launch of Articles, a new content type for Stack Overflow Teams that lets you write longer, subjective pieces. Sometimes it's best to share knowledge through Q&A, but other times you've got complicated, narrative, DevOps recipes or a policy paper and FAQ. Now your knowledge artifacts can all live in one place.\u00a0<br /><br />\"The FAQ is the great folk form of the internet\" - quotable moments featuring Paul Ford.<br /><br />If you're interested in another cut at this old saw, <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/developer\" target=\"_blank\">Mailchimp.com/developer</a>\u00a0is Postlight's take on what developer docs should look like. Sara is convinced it's all about the left nav.<br /><br />Speaking of convictions, a conflict is tearing Sara's home apart. Ben and Paul step in to save her marriage. The question at hand: should managers of developers EVER make technical decisions?<br /><br />Finally, Paul talks about his experience using Google Cloud Run to build a fun little tool called <a href=\"https://ephemeralist-ixz4p7lmaq-ue.a.run.app/\">Ephemeralist</a>. It pulls in random images from public domain collections hosted by museums and archives. Use it to take a break from the negativity of social media or the news. Also, revel in the joy of Paul's neologism, the Browseulator. It recently brought me this little <a href=\"https://ia801206.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/29/items/AcornUser088-Nov89/AcornUser088-Nov89_jp2.zip&file=AcornUser088-Nov89_jp2/AcornUser088-Nov89_0041.jp2&ext=jpg\">gem.</a></p>\n",
