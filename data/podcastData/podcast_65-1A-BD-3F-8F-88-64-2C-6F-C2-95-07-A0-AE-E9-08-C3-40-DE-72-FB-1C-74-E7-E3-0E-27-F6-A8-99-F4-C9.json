    "Description": "A big part of the developer culture is sharing knowledge, writing blog posts, and posting code. You show your passion for coding by putting your work out there, but how do you show that passion if you can't publish your work? What if your job requires you to keep your work private? What if being quiet is part of being safe online? We talk to Se\u00e1n Hanson about what it means to be a quiet developer and how passion doesn't always have to be loud.
