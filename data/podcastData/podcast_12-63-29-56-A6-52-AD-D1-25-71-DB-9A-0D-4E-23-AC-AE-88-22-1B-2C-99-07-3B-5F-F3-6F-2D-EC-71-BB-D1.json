    "Description": "<p>On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Emma Bostian. She's a software engineer turned manager at Spotify and Prolific coding teacher.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How at her first developer job at IBM, Emma's boss told her: \"You need to get your stuff together or you won't make it in this industry.\" And the transformation that followed.</p> <p>- Emma's thoughts on Computer Science degrees. \"Going to college gives you credibility and a network. You can get opportunities that way.\"</p> <p>- How Emma hires software engineers. (Hint: she tries to disregard degrees completely.)</p> <p>- How Emma intentionally procrastinates some big tasks to give her mind time to figure out the puzzle pieces</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1979 punk song.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 10,776 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
