    "Description": "\n        <p>Bayesian methods take the spotlight in this episode with Alex Andorra, co-founder of PyMC Labs, and Jon Krohn. Learn how Bayesian techniques handle tough problems, make the most of prior knowledge, and work wonders with limited data. Alex and Jon break down essentials like PyMC, PyStan, and NumPyro libraries, show how to boost model efficiency with PyTensor, and talk about using ArviZ for top-notch diagnostics and visualizations. Plus, get into advanced modeling with Gaussian Processes.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"https://crawlbase.com/\">Crawlbase</a>, the ultimate data crawling platform.
