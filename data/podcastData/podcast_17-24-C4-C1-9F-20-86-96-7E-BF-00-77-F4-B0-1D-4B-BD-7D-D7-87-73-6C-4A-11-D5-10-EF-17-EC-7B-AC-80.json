    "Description": "\n        <p>As an entrepreneur, you have a clear vision for your business. You know exactly what you want the future to look like. The problem is: Your team may not share the same vision. Or worse, they may not even know what your vision is! In this episode of The EntreLeadership Podcast, we sit down with Louie Giglio. Louie is the pastor of Passion City Church in Atlanta, Georgia, and the co-founder of the Passion Movement. He talks about how he stewards his organization's vision and continually finds ways to communicate that vision to his team. Then George Kamel chats with Ramsey Solutions Chief Marketing Officer Jen Sievertsen. They discuss what a vision really is and how to effectively communicate yours to your team.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6326584/a4a9eea55e60\">Take <em>The EntreLeadership Podcast</em> Audience Survey</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/shows/the-entreleadership-podcast\">The EntreLeadership Podcast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/37YwJzh\">Louie Giglio's website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sA7YCL\"><em>Don't Give the Enemy a Seat at Your Table</em></a> by Louie Giglio</p><p>Recent Episode with Kacy Maxwell: <a href=\"https://apple.co/3gjnheu\">How to Tell if You're Making the Right Decisions</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OSG2Hx\">Download the Team Communication Field Guide.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3aK6crS\">Schedule a call with Tim, our producer</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more about the offers from our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2RnQVWk\">EntreLeadership Partners</a>:</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3epUiVK\">BELAY</a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https://lp.gravysolutions.io/entreleadership\">Gravy</a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.hitedigital.com/entreleadership/\">Hite Digital</a></p>\n      ",
