    "Description": "<p>A high school class on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)\">Pascal</a> launched Andi\u2019s interest in programming (starting on an Apple IIc).</p><p>Andi was bored with his university studies and took on an extra-credit programming project that turned into <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/history.php.php\">PHP3</a>, the version that built a million websites.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/why-developers-hate-php/\">PHP gets a lot of hate</a>, and we have two theories about why. First, it\u2019s primarily brownfield development, and we all know that hell is other people\u2019s code. Second, it democratized development\u2014a great thing in many ways - that nevertheless led to a lot of less than professional code making it\u2019s way to production.</p><p>Andi cofounded Zend Technologies to oversee PHP advances and served as CEO from 2009 until the company\u2019s acquisition in 2015. After Zend Technology, Andi became one of what he jokes was \u201cfive folks in a garage\u201d building <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andigutmans/status/1001962262846898176\">a new graph database for Amazon</a>.</p><p>Now, at Google, Andi runs the operational database for Google Cloud Platform, including managed third parties and cloud-native databases <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/spanner\">Spanner</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable\">Bigtable</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore\">Firestore</a>.</p><p>His background in programming makes Andi sensitive to the importance of prioritizing <a href=\"https://developerexperience.io/practices/good-developer-experience\">developer experience</a>: \u201cthe number-one person using our services are our developers. And so we need to make [our technology] super-productive and simple and easy and fun for developers to use.\u201d</p><p>Connect with Andi on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andigutmans/\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n",
