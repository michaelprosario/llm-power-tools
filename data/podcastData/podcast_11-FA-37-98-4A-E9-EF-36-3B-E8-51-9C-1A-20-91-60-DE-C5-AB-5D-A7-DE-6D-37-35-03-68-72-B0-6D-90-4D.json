    "Description": "<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sean Pinnock, the CEO of Avalon, which is a human centric game studio, was my guest on The Intern Whisperer. When he was a child, he envisioned the future of games. His inspiration came from Ready Player One - which is a book by Ernest Cline that later became a movie. This shaped his thinking of what the world - Meta - could be as a VR experience.</p>\n<p>When sharing his mentoring advice, he reminds us to learn and be content with who you are today; the second piece of advice is to be determined. Determination will take you further in your life journey.</p>\n<p>The Intern Whisperer Podcast\u00a0is brought to you by\u00a0Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.</p>\n<p>Apply today to be an #Employer4Change that invests in #intern #talent and #employees.</p>\n<p>Want a break?
