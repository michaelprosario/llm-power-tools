    "Description": "<p>Please support us! https://www.patreon.com/mlst \nhttps://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5\nhttps://twitter.com/MLStreetTalk</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>YT version (with intro not found here) https://youtu.be/6iaT-0Dvhnc\n\nThis is the epic special edition show you have been waiting for! With two of the most brilliant scientists alive today. \n\nAtoms, things, agents, ... observers. What even defines an &quot;observer&quot; and what properties must all observers share? How do objects persist in our universe given that their material composition changes over time? What does it mean for a thing to be a thing? And do things supervene on our lower-level physical reality? What does it mean for a thing to have agency? What&#39;s the difference between a complex dynamical system with and without agency? Could a rock or an AI catflap have agency? Can the universe be factorised into distinct agents, or is agency diffused? Have you ever pondered about these deep questions about reality?\n\nProf. Friston and Dr. Wolfram have spent their entire careers, some 40+ years each thinking long and hard about these very questions and have developed significant frameworks of reference on their respective journeys (the Wolfram Physics project and the Free Energy principle). </p>\n<p>\nPanel: MIT Ph.D Keith Duggar\nProduction: Dr. Tim Scarfe\n\nRefs:\nTED Talk with Stephen:\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_how_to_think_computationally_about_ai_the_universe_and_everything\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/10/how-to-think-computationally-about-ai-the-universe-and-everything/\n\nTOC\n00:00:00 - Show kickoff</p>\n<p>00:02:38 - Wolfram gets to grips with FEP</p>\n<p>00:27:08 - How much control does an agent/observer have</p>\n<p>00:34:52 - Observer persistence, what universe seems like to us</p>\n<p>00:40:31 - Black holes</p>\n<p>00:45:07 - Inside vs outside</p>\n<p>00:52:20 - Moving away from the predictable path</p>\n<p>00:55:26 - What can observers do</p>\n<p>01:06:50 - Self modelling gives agency</p>\n<p>01:11:26 - How do you know a thing has agency?</p>\n<p>01:22:48 - Deep link between dynamics, ruliad and AI</p>\n<p>01:25:52 - Does agency entail free will?
