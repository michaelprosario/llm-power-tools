    "Description": "<p>Lindsay Fell is using augmented reality in the classroom (and so much more.) Today she shares five favorite augmented reality tools (plus one more.)</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e395\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e395</a></p> <p>Today's sponsor: <a href=\"http://www.projectpals.com\">Project Pals</a> has a useful classroom collaborative platform that lets you create and manage projects for your students. Right now, my students are creating and managing a project as they are creating a podcast to record powerful stories from the recent storms in our area. Project Pals connects with Google Classroom but also lets me see detail on which students are contributing and participating. I also love the task board which is a Trello-like Kanban board that let students create, assign, and complete tasks. I will be featuring this tool on my blog and newsletter this week- go to projectpals.com and sign up today.</p>",
