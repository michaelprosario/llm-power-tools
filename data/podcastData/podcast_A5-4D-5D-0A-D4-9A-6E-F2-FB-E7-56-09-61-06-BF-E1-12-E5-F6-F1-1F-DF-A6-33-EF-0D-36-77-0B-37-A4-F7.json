Despite delivering quality work, they were viewed as a \"difficult team\" by stakeholders. When Zvone joined, he conducted assessments and introduced <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram\"> context diagramming to map the team's relationships and dependencies</a>. This exercise revealed the complexity of their communication network and helped the team understand that cutting off relationships with stakeholders was counterproductive. The breakthrough came when the team began using the context diagram to explain their situation to others, helping stakeholders recognize how organizational factors were affecting the team's work.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How might mapping your team's communication network reveal disconnects that are affecting your effectiveness?</p>   Featured Book of the Week: Agile Transformation by Michael Spayd <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Zvonimir recommends <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4jdhwwU\"> \"Agile Transformation\" by Michael Spayd</a>  as a resource that helped him understand how to examine systems through different lenses. The book provides multiple perspectives for gaining deeper insights into the systems we work with. Zvone particularly values the book\u2019s ability to help practitioners look beyond surface-level issues and understand underlying dynamics in organizations undergoing Agile transformations.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this section we talk about the <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://integralagile.com/\"> Integral agile transformation framework</a>.</p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\ude80 Global Agile Summit 2025</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Join us in  Tallinn, Estonia, from  May 18th \u2013 20th, 2025, for an event that will inspire, challenge, and equip you with  real-world Agile success stories.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83c\udf0d Connect with global Agile leaders.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udca1 Learn practical strategies for impact.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \ud83d\udd25 Break free from Agile fatigue and  become a Pragmatic Innovator.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/the-global-agile-summit-program/?utm_source=e1125_3_smtp\">  Check Full Program</a></p>   [Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends] <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  About Zvonimir Durcevic</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Zvonimir has worked in agile product development since 2005, holding roles such as Scrum Master, Agile Coach, IT Project, and R&D Manager.
