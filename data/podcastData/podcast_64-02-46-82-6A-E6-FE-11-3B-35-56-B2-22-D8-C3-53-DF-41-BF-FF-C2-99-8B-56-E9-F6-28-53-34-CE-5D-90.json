    "Description": "<p>We explore connections between FEP and enactivism, including tensions raised in a paper critiquing FEP from an enactivist perspective.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Dr. Maxwell Ramstead provides background on enactivism emerging from autopoiesis, with a focus on embodied cognition and rejecting information processing/computational views of mind. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Chris shares his journey from robotics into FEP, starting as a skeptic but becoming convinced it&#39;s the right framework. He notes there are both &quot;high road&quot; and &quot;low road&quot; versions, ranging from embodied to more radically anti-representational stances. He doesn&#39;t see a definitive fork between dynamical systems and information theory as the source of conflict. Rather, the notion of operational closure in enactivism seems to be the main sticking point.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The group explores definitional issues around structure/organization, boundaries, and operational closure. Maxwell argues the generative model in FEP captures organizational dependencies akin to operational closure. The Markov blanket formalism models structural interfaces.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We discuss the concept of goals in cognitive systems - Chris advocates an intentional stance perspective - using notions of goals/intentions if they help explain system dynamics. Goals emerge from beliefs about dynamical trajectories. Prof Friston provides an elegant explanation of how goal-directed behavior naturally falls out of the FEP mathematics in a particular &quot;goldilocks&quot; regime of system scale/dynamics. The conversation explores the idea that many systems simply act &quot;as if&quot; they have goals or models, without necessarily possessing explicit representations. This helps resolve tensions between enactivist and computational perspectives.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Throughout the dialogue, Maxwell presses philosophical points about the FEP abolishing what he perceives as false dichotomies in cognitive science such as internalism/externalism. He is critical of enactivists&#39; commitment to bright line divides between subject areas.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Prof. Karl Friston - Inventor of the free energy principle https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q_4u0aoAAAAJ</p>\n<p>Prof. Chris Buckley - Professor of Neural Computation at Sussex University https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=nWuZ0XcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</p>\n<p>Dr. Maxwell Ramstead - Director of Research at VERSES https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ILpGOMkAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We address critique in this paper: </p>\n<p>Laying down a forking path: Tensions between enaction and the free energy principle (Ezequiel A.
