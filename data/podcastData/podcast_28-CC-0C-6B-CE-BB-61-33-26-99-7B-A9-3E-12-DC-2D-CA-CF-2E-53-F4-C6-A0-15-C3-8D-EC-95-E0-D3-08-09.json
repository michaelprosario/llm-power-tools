    "Description": "She spent over 12 years as a chef. But when Adrienne Lowe decided to invest in coding skills, she didn\u2019t want to leave her culinary love behind. So she merged those two worlds in her blog, a mix of tech and food that got her invited to talk at conference and fall deeper into the coding world she\u2019d discovered. Adrienne shares how she uses her cooking skills to be a better coder, how her love of the python community has made her a passionate community builder, and how a major life event got her started.
