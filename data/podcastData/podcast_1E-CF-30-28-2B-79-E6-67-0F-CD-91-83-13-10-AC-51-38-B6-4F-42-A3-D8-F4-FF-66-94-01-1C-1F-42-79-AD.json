    "Description": "<p>William Morgan, founder of the Linkerd service mesh and CEO of Bouyant, joins SE Radio\u2019s <a href= \"../../team/robert-blumen/\">Robert Blumen</a> for a discussion of sidecars, service mesh, and a forthcoming enhancement to kubernetes to support sidecars natively. The conversation explores the origin of sidecars, sidecars and service mesh, and migrating service mesh to kubernetes. They take a deep dive into some aspects of running service mesh on kubernetes, the difficulties in running a sidecar container in a pod, and Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) 753, which is intended to provide better native support for sidecar containers. William also gives some thoughts on the continuing relevance of service mesh.</p>",
