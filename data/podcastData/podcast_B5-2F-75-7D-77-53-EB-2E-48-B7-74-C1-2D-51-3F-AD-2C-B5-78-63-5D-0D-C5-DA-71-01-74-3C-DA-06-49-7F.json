    "Description": "<p>Ready for some real-time intelligence? Richard chats with Yitzhak Kesselman about Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric. Yitzhak talks about what it means to be real-time - that your company has a data analytics need with an ROI affected by a short amount of time. Perhaps it's a factory making products incorrectly or even issues with response times in a call center. The process involves bringing streaming data sources into the real-time hub and then attaching dashboards to them to see data as it changes. Fabric simplifies this tooling so domain experts can do much of the exploration. Once you have valuable and actionable information coming in, you have the activator options, including messaging via email or Teams, all the way to Power Automate to affect almost anything!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-hub/real-time-hub-overview?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Fabric Real-Time Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Real-Time Dashboard</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/release-plan/real-time-intelligence?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Real-Time Activator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/power-automate\">Power Automate</a></li></ul><p>Recorded October 29, 2024</p>\n",
