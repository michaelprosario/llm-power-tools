    "Description": "<p>It\u2019s hard not to love cheese: feta, brie, gruy\u00e8re, parmesan, pepper jack, mozzarella, asiago...it\u2019s all delicious! But there\u2019s a downside \u2014 cheese production is quite taxing on the environment, with dairy cows being one of the leading contributors to carbon emissions worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>That\u2019s where Matt Gibson and Inja Radman step in. They\u2019re the founders of New Culture, a company developing real dairy cheese, but without using cows or any other animal product.&nbsp;</p><p>This week on <em>How I Built This Lab, </em>Matt and Inja discuss their innovative and sustainable approach to cheese-making, and the partnerships they\u2019ve secured with major food distributors to roll out their product starting next year. Plus, we hear how Matt and Inja first connected on LinkedIn, deciding to launch a company together from across the world before ever meeting in person.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
