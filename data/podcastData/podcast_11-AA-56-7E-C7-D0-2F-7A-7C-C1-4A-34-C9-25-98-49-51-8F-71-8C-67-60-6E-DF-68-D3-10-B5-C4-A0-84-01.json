The book shows how the burdens imposed on startups by venture capital\u2014as well as the benefits and costs of \u201cmoving fast and breaking things\u201d\u2014are unevenly distributed across a company\u2019s workforce and customers. With its focus on the financialization of innovation, Behind the Startup explains how the gains generated by tech startups are funneled into the pockets of a small cadre of elite investors and entrepreneurs. To promote innovation that benefits the many rather than the few, Shestakofsky argues that we should focus less on fixing the technology and more on changing the financial infrastructure that supports it.</i></p><p>A big thanks to our user of the week, Parusnik, who was awarded a Great Question badge for asking: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46843863/how-to-run-a-net-core-console-application-on-linux\">How to run a .NET Core console application on Linux?</a></p>\n",
