    "Description": "<p>This week Jonathan Bennett and David Ruggles chat with John Britton and Mike McQuaid about Homebrew, the missing package manager for macOS, and Workbrew, the commercial offering built on top of it. We cover lots of territory, like why the naming scheme sounds like it was conceived during a pub visit, how Workbrew helps businesses actually use Homebrew, and why you might even want to run Homebrew on a Linux machine!</p> <p>You can join the conversation in\u00a0<a href= \"https://discord.gg/GNeFvChvnz?event=1217585022589206670\">the Hackaday Discord</a>, watch live or get the video version of the show on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@FLOSSWeekly\">Youtube</a>, as well as getting the full story and show links from <a href= \"https://hackaday.com/floss\">Hackaday</a>.
