Direction became something that was a luxury for me to think about which is an incredibly dangerous place to be as an executive and it's really easy to fall into it especially when there's a fire hose of work that's coming at you all the time.</p><p>And then I had morphed my life around work versus around my health and I realized the thing that had led me to have so much mental clarity before was my health. And so I started taking health incredibly seriously again.\u201d</p><p>- Vinay Hiremath \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Our in-person conference</strong> <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\"><strong>ELC Annual</strong></a> <strong>returns 10/27-28!</strong></h2><p>Learn from 60+ of the best engineering leaders in the industry / Critical insights on leadership, career and technology / Plus tons of experiences optimized for deep conversations & meaningful connections - all to help you build your support network!</p><p><i><strong>Don't miss out on being part of the biggest celebration of engineering leadership of the year!</strong></i></p><h3>Grab your ticket HERE: <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\"><strong>sfelc.com/annual2022</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Vinay\u2019s experience taking on three exec roles at Loom (3:51)</li><li>Why creating a daily timetable is crucial for busy eng leaders (6:02)</li><li>The intersection between mental health & living by your values (9:14)</li><li>What Vinay\u2019s personal values are & ways he identified them (10:35)</li><li>Incorporating the value of freedom within your eng org (11:35)</li><li>How your goals & competencies act as gatekeepers to your values (16:25)</li><li>Tips for building out your schedule to expand your working capacity (19:02)</li><li>The importance of understanding your systems (20:11)</li><li>As you scale your eng functions, set up delegation systems (21:49)</li><li>Why eng teams should utilize budgets & triple verification (25:48)</li><li>How triple verification works in people systems (27:07)</li><li>What the CEO role taught Vinay about leading engineering (31:40)</li><li>How Loom tackles the stigma surrounding parental leave (33:40)</li><li>Prioritize mental & physical health to live out your values (35:48)</li><li>Journaling frameworks to contemplate values (40:28)</li><li>Vinay\u2019s process for building \u2013 and keeping \u2013 new habits (43:03)</li><li>Recognize your emotions & act despite them (47:07)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (48:28)</li></ul>\n",
