    "Description": "<h2>How eng orgs (and careers) evolve through hyper-growth w/ Samir Naik #77</h2><p>Samir Naik (Head of Engineering, Core Products @ Plaid) shares how Plaid\u2019s engineering org has evolved over the last 10 years & the many unexpected ways his own career has transformed alongside Plaid. Samir deconstructs 3 different growth phases at Plaid, the indicators that your company is ready for the next growth stage, and how to choose an emerging tech city to expand to! Plus critical questions that helped guide Samir\u2019s career within Plaid.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirnaik/\"><strong>SAMIR NAIK</strong></a></h2><p>Samir Naik (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/samirnaik\">@samirnaik</a>) is Head of Engineering for Plaid\u2019s Core Products, overseeing a cross-functional team of product managers, engineers, designers, marketers building and scaling our core APIs. Having worn many hats throughout his years at Plaid, he\u2019s managed teams large and small and as the first external engineering manager hire, he\u2019s been instrumental in building Plaid\u2019s engineering function from the ground up. Previously, Samir led teams at Dropbox, Zynga, and Disney.</p><blockquote><p>\"I made the comment... I was like, 'I don't think a lot of this is really engineering focused, right? It doesn't seem super relevant to the engineering team...\"</p></blockquote><p>And he kind of just paused and looked at me and was like, 'That is your job! Doesn't matter if it's engineering or not, you need to fix these problems.'</p><p>And I think it was a mindset shift for me, and it was really helpful feedback. But I think it kind of framed that there's a bunch of seams in an organization. Doesn't matter whether they're engineering or not, but I really need to look for those seams and those opportunities and make sure they're addressed, whether that's in my job description or not.</p><blockquote><p>- Samir Naik \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Check out our friends and sponsor,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/sfelc/Jellyfish.co/elc\"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></a>.
