    "Description": "<p>One of the most important aspects of success is a team\u2019s ability to collaborate \u2013 but it can also be one of the most challenging parts. In this episode, we\u2019re highlighting a popular session ELC Annual 2024 on how to encourage collaboration, ultimately increasing productivity and creating more likely outcomes of success. This conversation features Marcel Weekes, VP of Product Engineering @ Figma, and Arquay Harris, former VP of Engineering @ Webflow. This conversation also features a robust Q&A session from ELC Annual attendees on their most pressing collaboration questions \u2013 including diagnosing teams that are struggling to collaborate, how to measure the success of collaborative tools, strategies for building rituals / processes around collaboration, and much more.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelweekes/\"><strong>MARCEL WEEKES</strong></a></h2><p>Marcel Weekes is VP of Product Engineering at Figma, where he oversees product and growth engineering efforts across Figma's entire platform. Marcel brings decades of experience and previously served as the VP of Engineering at Slack where he led the teams building Messaging features and Slack Connect.</p><blockquote><p>\"A trait of product engineers that I have found to be successful in predicting positive outcomes is they view code as a tool to get something done. Engineers on the other end of the spectrum who might be more elite code engineers or more like, \u2018I got this algorithm to go like .005 percent faster,\u2019 frankly that's not what's going to get your product to product market fit. If you're not focused on the end goal here, you're going to make suboptimal decisions the whole way.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Marcel Weekes \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arquay/\"><strong>ARQUAY HARRIS</strong></a></h2><p>Arquay has held Engineering leadership positions at Slack, Google and CBS Interactive.
