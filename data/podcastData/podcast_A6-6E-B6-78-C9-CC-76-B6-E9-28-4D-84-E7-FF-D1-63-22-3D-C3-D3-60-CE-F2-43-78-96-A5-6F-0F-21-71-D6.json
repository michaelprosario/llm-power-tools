    "Description": "<p>Dr. Brianna Kurtz, classroom teacher and researcher, studied \"global practices in returning to formal schooling after interruptions in education due to natural disasters.\" She studied students displaced after Hurricane Maria and what helped them resume schooling successfully. Today, she shares what we can learn from her research as well as some emerging research on best practices for teaching during the pandemic.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e701\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e701</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Sponsor: Planboard & Chalk As we prepare to teach in a blended or distance learning environment, a rock-solid lesson planner is a must. I use a free program called <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/planboard?utm_source=coolcatteacher\">Planboard</a> for my lesson planning. My school uses Planboard with <a href= \"https://www.chalk.com/\">Chalk.com</a>\u2019s curriculum planning tool. This powerful tool links with standards -- and gives us the ability to do some timesaving, efficient reporting and tracking. The best thing about Planboard is I can plan my lessons anywhere - on my Mac, PC or iPad. Wherever I work, my lesson plans are with me. And as I said, Planboard is FREE for teachers. I hope you\u2019ll check out Planboard now!</p> Dr. Briana Kurtz - Bio as Submitted <p>Dr. Brianna Kurtz has been an educator in high school and community college mathematics classrooms for fifteen years.
