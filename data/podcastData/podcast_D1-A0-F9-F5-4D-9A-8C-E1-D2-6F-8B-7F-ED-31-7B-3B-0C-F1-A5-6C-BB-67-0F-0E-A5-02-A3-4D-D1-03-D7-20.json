    "Description": "  Karen Suarez: How to Design Communication Channels to Protect Agile Team Focus, and Avoid Interruptions <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  As a first-time Scrum Master managing a team of 15-20 people, Karen focused primarily on protecting them from constant interruptions in their open office space. However, she soon realized this approach was creating barriers between the team and stakeholders. Karen developed strategies to balance protection with accessibility by establishing \"office hours\" when the team could be interrupted, creating dedicated communication channels (like Slack) to collect stakeholder questions, and always including the Product Owner when change requests came in. This balanced approach maintained team focus while keeping communication lines open.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, we refer to the <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://oikosofyseries.com/po-course-presentation/?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolboxPodcast\">  Coach Your Product Owner e-course</a>, available to all who need to support their product owners with understanding, and adopting an Agile way of working.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How might creating structured interruption times help your team maintain focus while still remaining accessible to stakeholders?</p>   Featured Book of the Week: The Scrum Guide <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Karen recommends repeatedly reading <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrumguides.org/index.html?utm_source=ScrumMasterToolboxPodcast\">  The Scrum Guide</a>  throughout your Agile journey.
