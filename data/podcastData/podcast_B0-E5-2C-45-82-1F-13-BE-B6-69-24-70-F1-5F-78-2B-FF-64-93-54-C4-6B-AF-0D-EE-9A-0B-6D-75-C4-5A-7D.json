    "SourceUrl": "https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/vets-who-code",
    "Description": "Plenty of organizations work to help vets. But what vet Jerome Hardaway noticed about these organizations is that they were mostly reactive. While they responded to problems, few worked to prevent them. So Jerome decided to create a non-profit to teach vets how to code, making it easier for them to start a tech career and better adjust to life back at home. We talk about the program, the stigma of being a vet, and Jerome\u2019s own journey to being a developer. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
