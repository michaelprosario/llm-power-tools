    "Description": "\n        <p>As a business owner, every time that you solve a problem it probably feels like you're doing your job. But, what if you're actually undermining your business' longterm potential for growth?</p><p>In this episode of the Business Accelerator podcast, Joel Miller attempts to answer that question through an exploration of a concept called \"choice architecture\" or \"choice design\".
