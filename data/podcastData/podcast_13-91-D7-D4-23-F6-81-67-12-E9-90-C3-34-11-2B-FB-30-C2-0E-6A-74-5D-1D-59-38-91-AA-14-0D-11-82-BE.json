    "Description": "<p>Can you migrate group policy objects to Intune? Richard chats with Katy Nicholson about her work modernizing Windows client machines through Microsoft Endpoint Manager, making on-premises Active Directory optional. Katy discusses using the Group Policy Analyzer to understand what policies will work through Endpoint Manager and Configuration Service Providers. The next question is, what policies are irrelevant or obsolete? This leads to a conversation around refreshing security for an organization - why does this policy exist. How is it applied to non-Windows devices? Does it still make sense? Ultimately, all policies are about security, which means getting to zero trust. How does policy work in a zero trust environment, and where do you have to make exceptions?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://katystech.blog/\">Katy's Blog</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-endpoint-manager\">Microsoft Endpoint Manager</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference\">Configuration Service Provider</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/configuration/group-policy-analytics\">Group Policy Analyzer</a></li><li><a href=\"https://katystech.blog/mem/intune-import-gpo\">Importing Group Policy Objects into Intune</a></li><li><a href=\"https://katystech.blog/azure/azure-ad-and-windows-hello-sso-to-on-premise-resources\">Azure AD and Windows Hello</a></li></ul><p>Recorded July 5, 2022</p>\n",
