    "Description": "<p>Freshpet co-founder Scott Morris helped transform pet food by sidestepping traditional kibble and cans, and making slice-and-serve meals that almost looked palatable enough for humans. When Scott and his partners launched the business in 2006, the concept of fresh pet food was so novel that retailers balked at installing special refrigerators for it. So Freshpet provided its own refrigerators, a logistical nightmare that nearly ground the business to a halt. More than 30,000 refrigerators later, Freshpet has a 96% share of the fresh pet food sector, with a customer base of 10 million dog and cat households.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Alex Cheng.</p><p>Our engineers were Gilly Moon and Maggie Luthar.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, and email us at <a href=\"mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hibt@id.wondery.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you in part by Canva, the easy-to-use online design platform for presentations, social posts, videos, websites, and more.
