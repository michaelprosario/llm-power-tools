    "Description": "Linda Liukas identifies more with being a children\u2019s author than a developer. That might be because she\u2019s spent a good amount of time helping others learn to code than actually coding herself. She used to work for Codecademy, started Rails Girls, and most recently launched a Kickstarter campaign for a book introducing programming to children. The campaign blew past it\u2019s $10K goal, and reached over $380K. Linda talks to us about drawing and writing the book, Hello Ruby, and what she\u2019s learned about the coding journey as she helps kids start their own. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
