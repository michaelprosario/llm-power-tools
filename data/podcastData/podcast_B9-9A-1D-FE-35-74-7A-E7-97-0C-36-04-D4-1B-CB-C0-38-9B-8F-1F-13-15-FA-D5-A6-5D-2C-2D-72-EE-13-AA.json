    "Description": "The first open source project Steve Klabnik got involved with was a pretty big one - he took on Hackety Hack, the beloved application that helped kids learn to code. He only meant to help out, but when no else joined, he ended up running the show, and diving headfirst into the open source world. Now, many years and pull requests later, Klabnik shares how he went from Hackety Hack to contributing to Rails to working full-time on the Rust language, and gives us a beginner-friendly overview of the open source world and many lessons he\u2019s learned along the way.
