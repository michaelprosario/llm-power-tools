    "Description": "\n        Our fifth episode from the 2019 <em>How I Built This </em>Summit features serial entrepreneur Marcia Kilgore, founder of Bliss, FitFlop, BeautyPie and more. The animating question behind all of Marcia's business ideas is 'So What?'\u2014 if she can't answer it, she doesn't pursue it.
