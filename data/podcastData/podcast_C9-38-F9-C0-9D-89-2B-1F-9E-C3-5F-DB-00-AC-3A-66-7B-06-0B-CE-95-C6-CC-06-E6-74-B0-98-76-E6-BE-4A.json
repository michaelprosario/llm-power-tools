    "Description": "<p>Developer tool integration and AI differentiate workflows to achieve that \"fluid\" state developers strive for in their work.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">Amazon CodeCatalyst</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/what-is-cwspr.html\">Amazon CodeWhisperer</a> exemplify how developer workflows are accelerating and helping to create these fluid states. That's a big part of the story we hear from Harry Mower, director AWS DevOps Services, and Doug Seven, director, Software Development, AWS CodeWhisperer, from our recording in Seattle earlier in April for this week's\u00a0<a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-event-LS-aws-developer-innovation-day-2023-reg-event.html\"> AWS Developer Innovation Day</a>.</p><p>CodeCatalyst serves as an end-to-end integrated DevOps toolchain that provides developers with everything they need to go from planning through to deployment, Mower said. CodeWhisperer is an AI coding companion that generates whole-line and full-line function code recommendations in an integrated development environment (IDE).</p><p>CodeWhisperer is part of the IDE, Seven said. The acceleration is two-fold. CodeCatalyst speeds the end-to-end integration process, and CodeWhisper accelerates writing code through generative AI.</p>\n",
