    "Description": "<p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers, Purnima Padmanabhan, a senior vice president at VMware, discusses three common mistakes organizations make when trying to move faster in meeting customer needs. The first mistake is equating application modernization with solely moving to the cloud, often resulting in a mere lift and shift of applications, without reaping the full benefits. The second mistake is a lack of automation, particularly in operations, which hinders the development process's speed. The third mistake involves adding unnecessary complexity by adopting new technologies or procedures, which slows down developers.</p><p>As a solution, Padmanabhan introduces the concept of platform engineering, which not only accelerates development but also reduces toil for operations engineers and architects. However, many organizations struggle with implementing it effectively, as they often approach platform engineering in fragmented ways, investing in separate components without fully connecting them.</p><p>To succeed in adopting platform engineering, Padmanabhan emphasizes the need for a mindset shift. The platform team must treat platform engineering as a continuously evolving product rather than a one-time delivery, ensuring that service-level agreements are continuously met, and regularly updating and improving features and velocity. The episode discusses the benefits of a well-implemented \"golden path\" for entire organizations and provides insights on how to start a platform engineering team.</p><p><i>Learn more from The New Stack about Platform Engineering and VMware:</i></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/\">Platform Engineering Overview, News and Trends</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineers-developers-are-your-customers/\">Platform Engineers: Developers Are Your Customers</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/open-source-platform-engineering-a-decade-of-cloud-foundry/\">Open Source Platform Engineering: A Decade of Cloud Foundry</a></p>\n",
