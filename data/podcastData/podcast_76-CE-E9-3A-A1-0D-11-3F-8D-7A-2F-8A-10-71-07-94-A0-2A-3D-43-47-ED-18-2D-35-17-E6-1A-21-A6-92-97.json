    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianldouglas\">Brian Douglas</a> was \u201cthe Beyonc\u00e9 of GitHub.\u201d He jokingly crowned himself with that title during his years at that company, where he advocated for open source and a more inclusive community supporting it. His work there eventually led to his new startup, <a href=\"https://opensauced.pizza/\">Open Sauced</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Like the Queen Bey, Douglas\u2019 mission is to empower a community. In his case, he\u2019s seeking to support the open source community. With his former employer, GitHub, serving 4 million developers worldwide, the potential size of that audience is huge.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In this episode of <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-idit-levines-athletic-past-fueled-solo-ios-startup/\">The Tech Founder Odyssey</a> podcast, he shared why empowerment and breaking down barriers to make anyone \u201cawesome\u201d in open source was the motivation behind his startup journey.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Beyonc\u00e9 \u201chas a superfan group, the Beyhive, that will go to bat for her,\u201d Douglas pointed out. \u201cSo if Beyonc\u00e9 makes a country song, the Beyhive is there supporting her country song. If she starts doing the house music, which is her latest album, [they] are there to the point where like, you cannot say bad stuff about, he pointed out,. So what I\u2019m focused on is having a strong community and having strong ties.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Open Sauced, which launched in June, seeks to build open source intelligence platform to help companies to stay competitive. Its aim is to help give more potential open source contributors the information they need to get started with projects, and help maintain them over time</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The conversation was co-hosted by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-coll-b971505/\">Colleen Coll</a> and <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/hjoslyn/\">Heather Joslyn</a> of The New Stack.</p><p><h2>Web 2.0 \u2018Opened the World\u2019</h2></p><p>Douglas\u2019 introduction to tech started as a kid \u201ccutting his teeth\u201d on a Packard Bell and a shared computer at the community center inside his apartment complex, where he grew up outside of Tampa, Florida.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don't know what computer was in there, but it ran DOS,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I got to play, like, Wolfenstein and eventually Duke Nukem and stuff like that. So that was my first sort of like, touch of a computer and I actually knew what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>With his MBA in finance, the last recession in 2008 left only sales jobs available. But Douglas always knew he wanted to \u201cbuild stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI've always been like a copy and paste [person] and loved playing DOS games,\u201d he told The New Stack. \u201cI eventually [created] a pretty nice MySpace profile. then someone told me \u2018Hey, you know, you could actually build apps now.\u2019</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd post Web 2.0. people have frameworks and rails and Django. You just have to run a couple scripts, and you've got a web page live and put that in Heroku, or another server, and you're good. And that opened the world.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Open Sauced began as a side project when he was director of developer advocacy at GitHub; He started working on the project full time in June, after about two years of tinkering with it.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Douglas didn\u2019t grow up with money, he said, so moving from as an employee to the risky life of a CEO seeking funding prompted him to create his own comprehensive strategy. This included content creation (including a podcast, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHyZ0Wz_A44VR4BXl_JOWSecQeWcZ-kS3\">The Secret Sauce</a>), other marketing, and shipping frontend code.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>GitHub was very supportive of him spinning off Open Sauced as an independent startup, with colleagues assisting in refining his pitches to venture capital investors to raise funds.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAt GitHub, they have inside of their employee employment contract a moonlight clause,\u201d Douglas said. Which means, he noted, because the company is powered by open source, \u201cbasically, whatever you work on, as long as you're not competing directly against GitHub, rebuilding it from the ground up, feel free to do whatever you need to do moonlight.\u201d</p><p><h2>Support for Blacks in Tech</h2></p><p>Open Sauced will also continue Douglas\u2019 efforts to increase representation of Blacks in tech and open pathways to level up their skills, similar to his work at GitHub with the Employee Resource Group (ERG) the <a href=\"https://github.com/about/diversity/communities-of-belonging/blacktocats\">Blacktocats</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe focus there was to make sure that people had a home, like a community of belonging,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you're a black employee at GitHub, you have a space and it was very helpful with things like 2020, during George Floyd. lt was the community [in which] we all supported each other during that situation.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Douglas\u2019 mission to rid the effects of imposter syndrome and champion anyone interested in open source makes him sound more like an open source \u201dwhisperer\u201d\u2019 than a Beyonc\u00e9. Whatever the title, his iconic pizza brand \u2014 the company\u2019s web address is <a href=\"https://opensauced.pizza/\">\u201copensauced.pizza\u201d</a> \u2014 was his version, he said, of creating album cover art before forming the band.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>His podcast\u2019s tagline urges listeners to \u201cstay saucy.\u201d His plan for doing that at Open Sauced is to encourage new open source contributors.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt's nice to know that projects can now opt in \u2026 but as a first-time contributor, where do I start? We can show you, \u2018Hey, this project had five contributions, they're doing a great job. Why don't you start here?\u2019</p>\n",
