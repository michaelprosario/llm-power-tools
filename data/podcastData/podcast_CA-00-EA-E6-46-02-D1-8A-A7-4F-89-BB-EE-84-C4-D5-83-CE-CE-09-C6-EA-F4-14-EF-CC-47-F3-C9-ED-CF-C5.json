    "Description": "<p> Today I'm joined by Patrick San Juan, a software engineer who first learned to code in his 30s.</p> <p>I've known Patrick since the early days of freeCodeCamp. He has always been a positive, supportive force within the community.</p> <p>Patrick grew up the son of first-generation immigrants from the Philippines. His family didn't have much money, and what they did have, they plowed into his education. He studied economics at the University of California at Santa Cruz, then went to work at a charity focused on helping underserved youth.</p> <p>After 5 years, Patrick decided to transition into a career where he could better support his family. And for him, that meant learning to code.</p> <p>I hung out with Patrick at the Alameda Public Library, in the San Francisco Bay Area where Patrick lives. We talk about the ups and downs of his journey into tech. Patrick doesn't sugarcoat anything. Getting a job as a developer is hard. But he's proof that with sustained effort, you can build a career for yourself in tech.</p> <p>I'm proud of Patrick and his achievements. And I'm proud to be the first person to ever interview him for a podcast.</p> <p>If you dig this podcast, be sure to leave us a review. And tell your friends about this show. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themsleves in tech.</p> <p>Patrick on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricksanjuan/ \u00a0</p>",
