    "Title": "Why the C64 Demoscene matters with Clay Token's Bilgem \u00c7ak\u0131r",
    "SourceUrl": "https://www.hanselminutes.com/",
    "Description": "<p>The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations. When was the last time you coded something that fit in 4k? How about just 1024 bytes? Bilgem \u00c7ak\u0131r is one of many folks still making the Commodore 64 sing and do things you'd never expect, 40 years after the computer was released. Why is this kind of coding important or interesting in 2022? Bilgem offers his perspective as game studio CTO, long time demoscener, and C64 demo record holder.</p><p><i>This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.
