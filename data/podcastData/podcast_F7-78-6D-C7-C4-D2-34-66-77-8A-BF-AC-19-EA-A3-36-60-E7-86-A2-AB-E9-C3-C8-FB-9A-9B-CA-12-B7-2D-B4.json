    "Description": "\n        <p>When steaks don\u2019t sell you shift to sticks; that\u2019s how Chomps was born. After several failed ventures\u2014one of which left him bankrupt\u2014Pete Maldonado decided to take&nbsp;another chance on launching a business. He partnered with Rashid Ali to start a mail-order service similar to Omaha Steaks, but with grass-fed meat that was more suited to the Paleo diet. When the partners couldn\u2019t get that off the ground, they shifted to individually-wrapped meat sticks; one of the first in a long line of \u2018healthier for you\u2019 protein snacks.&nbsp;For several years, each co-founder tried to manage the business as a side-hustle, but the sausage hit the fan in 2016 when a surprise order from Trader Joe\u2019s left them scrambling to produce a million sticks.&nbsp;Today, Chomps is available in major chains across the country and pulls in more than $100 million a year.&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
