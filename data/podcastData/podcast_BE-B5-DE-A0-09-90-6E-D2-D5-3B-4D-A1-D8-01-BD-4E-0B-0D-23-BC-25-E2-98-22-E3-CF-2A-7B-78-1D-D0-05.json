    "Description": "<p>In this episode, we chat with Lake Dai (Founder & Managing Partner @ Sancus Ventures), who shares her career story & how to harness AI technology in a way that is both effective & compassionate. We cover the concept of \u201cco-parenting AI\u201d; why ethics in AI is non-negotiable; and how to create compassionate AI. Lake also reveals how she became a veteran at serving on boards & why it is something she is passionate about. We dissect ways current eng leaders who are interested in board service can gain the right experiences & demonstrate their value as a potential board member.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakedai\"><strong>LAKE DAI</strong></a></h2><p>Lake Dai is Founder and Managing Partner of Sancus Ventures, a VC firm focused on pre-seed to seed stage companies, investing in the next generation of software infrastructure for applications, such as distributed computing, AI model management, platform scalability, data privacy & safety, cybersecurity and more.</p><p>Lake has been an Adjunct Professor of Applied AI at Carnegie Mellon University since 2016. She was a keynote speaker on AI ethics, data privacy, real-world applications, and AI education topics at the UN, UK Parliament, California State, and leading tech conferences such as the MIT conference and VentureBeat.</p><blockquote><p>\"Students ask, 'Why do I have to study AI ethics? Why can't I just jump into how do I build this model?' If you imagine AI as a very powerful tool, there is no difference between teaching building AI tools from teaching people how to use a weapon. If you ever take any weapon training classes, the first thing people teach you is safety, which is really understanding how the weapon works and how much impact both on the positive and negative side to people surround you. That part is missing for a lot of AI technical training these days.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Lake Dai \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://testrigor.com/?utm_source=ELC&utm_medium=paid-ad&utm_campaign=FY24-Q1-ELC-podcast&utm_content=home-page&utm_term=view\">testRigor</a>!</h2><p><a href=\"https://testrigor.com/?utm_source=ELC&utm_medium=paid-ad&utm_campaign=FY24-Q1-ELC-podcast&utm_content=home-page&utm_term=view\">testRigor</a> is trusted by tens of thousands of companies across the globe, including Netflix, Splunk, BusinessWire, and more to solve three main problems with end-to-end test automation:</p><ol><li>It\u2019s challenging, expensive, and slow to hire QA Automation Engineers</li><li>Low productivity building your own QA Automation</li><li>Fragile tests, that cause maintenance to consume enormous amounts of time</li></ol><h3>testRigor solves all of the above by allowing our users to express test cases in plain English</h3><h3>To learn more, check out a case study on testRigor <a href=\"https://testrigor.com/assets/pdf/IDT_testRigor_case_study.pdf\">here</a></h3><h3>Sign up for a free trial today at <a href=\"http://testrigor.com/\">testrigor.com</a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Why VC fundraising is set to thrive in 2024 & beyond (2:14)</li><li>Eng leaders should focus on AI ethics (6:09)</li><li>The importance of starting with a safety check before implementing technology (8:14)</li><li>Lake\u2019s recommendations for eng leaders to guide current & future AI dev (9:46)</li><li>Third-party involvement with internal building processes (12:22)</li><li>Strategies for helping engineers address AI dev in a mid or late-stage roadmap (14:06)</li><li>The concept of co-parenting AI & its implication for eng leaders (15:40)</li><li>Benevolent AI & feeding AI compassion information / data (18:50)</li><li>How to harness AI to address societal challenges & create positive outcomes (22:42)</li><li>Examples of AI addressing climate change & education-related issues (24:44)</li><li>Three reasons why Lake is passionate about serving on boards (28:33)</li><li>The positive impact of serving as a board member (31:40)</li><li>How to gain the right experience & demonstrate value to get on a board (33:21)</li><li>Why it\u2019s important to let others know you\u2019re looking for a board role (35:17)</li><li>Rapid fire questions (40:51)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61153739\">Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity</a> - Wouldn\u2019t you like to live longer?
