    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Tom Arbuthnot about how Microsoft Lync impacts business processes. Going beyond 'What is Lync', Tom talks about how the integration of IM, email and voice together presents opportunities for automating workflow. Tom sites the example of a timesheet that follows you around until you fill it in. He also discusses the goal of reducing email by creating opportunities for immediate response using the presence that Lync creates. Ultimately the goal is to see how Lync improves your business beyond just saving money on web seminars. Check out Tom's Lync'd Up Blog for more Lync goodness.</p>\n",
