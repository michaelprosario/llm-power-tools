    "Description": "<p>OpenSearch has evolved significantly since its 2021 launch, recently reaching a major milestone with its move to the Linux Foundation. This shift from company-led to foundation-based governance has accelerated community contributions and enterprise adoption, as discussed by NetApp\u2019s Amanda Katona in a\u00a0<i>New Stack Makers</i>\u00a0episode recorded at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe. NetApp, an early adopter of OpenSearch following Elasticsearch\u2019s licensing change, now offers managed services on the platform and contributes actively to its development.</p><p>Katona emphasized how neutral governance under the Linux Foundation has lowered barriers to enterprise contribution, noting a 56% increase in downloads since the transition and growing interest from developers. OpenSearch 3.0, featuring a Lucene 10 upgrade, promises faster search capabilities\u2014especially relevant as data volumes surge. NetApp\u2019s ongoing investments include work on machine learning plugins and developer training resources.</p><p>Katona sees the Linux Foundation\u2019s involvement as key to OpenSearch\u2019s long-term success, offering vendor-neutral governance and reassuring users seeking openness, performance, and scalability in data search and analytics.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about OpenSearch:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/report-opensearch-bests-elasticsearch-at-vector-modeling/\">Report: OpenSearch Bests ElasticSearch at Vector Modeling</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/aws-transfers-opensearch-to-the-linux-foundation/\">AWS Transfers OpenSearch to the Linux Foundation</a>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/opensearch-how-the-project-went-from-fork-to-foundation/\">OpenSearch: How the Project Went From Fork to Foundation</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
