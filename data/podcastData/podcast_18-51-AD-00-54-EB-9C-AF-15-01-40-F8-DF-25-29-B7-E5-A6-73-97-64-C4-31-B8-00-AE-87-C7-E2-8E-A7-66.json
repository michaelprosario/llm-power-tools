    "Title": "Talking about drag and drop tech stacks with Builder.io's Steve Sewell",
    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>Steve was working as an engineering manager at <a href=\"https://www.shopstyle.com/\">ShopStyle</a> and found that an increasing amount of his team's time was spent working on custom requests from departments like marketing and sales. They tried moving to a headless CMS but the data and components couldn't keep up with ever evolving needs. They wanted a drag and drop system connected to their code, data, and components.</p><p>This pain point inspired him strike out on his own to create a new product. The vision was a tool that would allow colleagues from across a company to make changes to web pages without requesting dev time, but would also ensure that any changes made would be up to the standards of the design department and not introduce errors that engineering would then have to fix.\u00a0</p><p>Hence, the company's pitch for a plug & play system that integrates with your existing sites & apps. It relies on a few key ideas:</p><ul><li>API-based infrastructure that is native to your tech stack</li><li>Works with any frontend or backend</li><li>Build with your own data, like product catalogs or customer data platforms, to create rich, dynamic experiences</li></ul><p>You can check it out for yourself over at <a href=\"https://www.builder.io/\">Builder.io</a>.</p><p>Follow Steve on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve8708\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@steve8708\">TikTok</a> where he breaks down websites and effects he finds interesting.</p><p>Congrats to phoenisx for being awarded the Necromaner badge after answering the question: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47831741/property-share-does-not-exist-on-type-navigator/61767007#61767007\">Property 'share' does not exist on type 'Navigator\"?\u00a0</a></p>\n",
