    "Description": "<p>Your company is sold on the idea of data analytics, but is it ready for it? Richard talks to Jen Stirrup about her experiences getting organizations started with data analytics, which means really focusing on the quality of the data that a company is collecting. Jen discusses her process of figuring out how data is collected, how often it needs to be corrected and how much gets missed and stays incorrect inside the data stores. The conversation also explores the other locations of important data for analysis like weblogs. As Jen says, some data problems are business puzzles and some are business mysteries - and it takes different tools and techniques to answer them!</p>\n",
