As the Founding Director of the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, Eliasmith leads the Computational Neuroscience Research Group in exploring the mysteries of the brain and its complex functions. His groundbreaking work, including the Neural Engineering Framework, Neural Engineering Objects software environment, and the Semantic Pointer Architecture, has led to the development of Spaun, the most advanced functional brain simulation to date. Among his numerous achievements, Eliasmith has received the 2015 NSERC &quot;Polany-ee&quot; Award and authored two influential books, &quot;How to Build a Brain&quot; and &quot;Neural Engineering.&quot;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Chris&#39; homepage:</p>\n<p>http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~celiasmi/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Interviewers: Dr. Tim Scarfe and Dr. Keith Duggar</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Intro to Chris [00:00:00]</p>\n<p>Continuous Representation in Biologically Plausible Neural Networks [00:06:49]</p>\n<p>Legendre Memory Unit and Spatial Semantic Pointer [00:14:36]</p>\n<p>Large Contexts and Data in Language Models [00:20:30]</p>\n<p>Spatial Semantic Pointers and Continuous Representations [00:24:38]</p>\n<p>Auto Convolution [00:30:12]</p>\n<p>Abstractions and the Continuity [00:36:33]</p>\n<p>Compression, Sparsity, and Brain Representations [00:42:52]</p>\n<p>Continual Learning and Real-World Interactions [00:48:05]</p>\n<p>Robust Generalization in LLMs and Priors [00:56:11]</p>\n<p>Chip design [01:00:41]</p>\n<p>Chomsky + Computational Power of NNs and Recursion [01:04:02]</p>\n<p>Spiking Neural Networks and Applications [01:13:07]</p>\n<p>Limits of Empirical Learning [01:22:43]</p>\n<p>Philosophy of Mind, Consciousness etc [01:25:35]</p>\n<p>Future of human machine interaction [01:41:28]</p>\n<p>Future research and advice to young researchers [01:45:06]</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Refs:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/dumont2023.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/dumont2023.html</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/voelker2019lmu.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/voelker2019lmu.html</a>\u00a0 </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/voelker2018.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/voelker2018.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/lu2019.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/lu2019.html</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5h-xjddzlY\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5h-xjddzlY</a></p>\n",
