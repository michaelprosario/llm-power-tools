    "Description": "<p>Tom Loud @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/loudlearning\">loudlearning</a> dropped out of high school because he didn\u2019t connect with his teachers. Somehow, he connected with books though and became a high school and college graduate. Now, Tom is a 10-year classroom veteran who is working to make his classroom (and help others) connect with kids in new ways. Today we\u2019ll talk about unleashing the potential in every child. And yes, you\u2019ll hear birds chirping, but that is ok!</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e151\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e151</a></p> <p>Today\u2019s sponsor is <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/edpuzzle\">Edpuzzle</a>, a favorite #flipclass tool.
