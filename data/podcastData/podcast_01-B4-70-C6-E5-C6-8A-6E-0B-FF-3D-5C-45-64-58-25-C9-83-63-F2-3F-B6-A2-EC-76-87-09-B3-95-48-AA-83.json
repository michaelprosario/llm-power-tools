His change strategy focuses on getting buy-in from crews by showing them \"what's in it for them.\" He starts with exercises that provide insight into how Lean ideas apply to their specific jobs, like the <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2508716_Parade_Of_Trades_A_Game_For_Understanding_Variability_And_Dependence\">  \"Parade of Trades\" simulation</a>  that demonstrates how one crew moving at twice the speed still gets stuck behind slower crews ahead. This reveals that predictability of progress matters more than speed of progress. Once teams become familiar with these concepts, Luca transitions from directive teaching to facilitating meetings and conversations, moving into the background to help teams become more sustainable in their Lean practices.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  In this segment, Luca refers to <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Karate_Kid\"> the movie Karate Kid from 1984</a>, and to <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints\"> Theory of Constraints</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How do you ensure that change initiatives show clear value to the people who must actually implement them?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
