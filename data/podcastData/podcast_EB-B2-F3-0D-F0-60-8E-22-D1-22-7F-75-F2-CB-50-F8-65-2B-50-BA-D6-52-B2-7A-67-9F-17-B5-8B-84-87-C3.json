    "Description": "<p>What can GitHub tell us about DevOps? Richard talks to Nicole Forsgren about her new role at GitHub, studying the behavior of developers (and many others) using the massive set of aggregate data that exists within GitHub. Nicole talks about expanding the annual State of the Octoverse report to dig deeply into development productivity, security, and the community of source code contributors. This opens the door to some great ideas on how operations and development can work together - and isn't that what DevOps is all about?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/\">Accelerate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.devops-research.com/research.html\">DevOps Research & Assessment</a></li><li><a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\">State of the Octoverse</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/features/security\">GitHub Security</a></li></ul>\n",
