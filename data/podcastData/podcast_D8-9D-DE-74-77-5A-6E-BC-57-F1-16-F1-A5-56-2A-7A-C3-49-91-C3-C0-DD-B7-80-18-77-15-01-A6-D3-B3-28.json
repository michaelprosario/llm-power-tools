    "Description": "<p>In this episode, we redefine what successful, productive engineering looks like with Tammarrian Rogers. As the former Inclusive Engineering Director @ Snap, Tammarrian shares her perspective on global relational healing and what pulled her away from her traditional eng leadership role to explore this topic further. We cover the importance of incorporating relational healing practices into eng leadership & product development, the importance of the \u201chealing profit,\u201d how technology can help manifest healing opportunities for users, and how to align eng teams on embracing relational healing as a practice. We also cover how individual eng leaders can build awareness around internal self-talk \u2013 critical & positive \u2013 and explore self-love / reflection practices daily.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammarrian/\">TAMMARRIAN ROGERS</a></h2><p>Tammarrian (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tammarrian\">@tammarrian</a>) has enjoyed acquiring over 30 years of engineering leadership experience in both hardware and software at General Motors, Apple, Microsoft and Snap.\u00a0 She has had the opportunity to lead cross-functional teams with a focus on inclusive product engineering, quality assurance, release management and product localization and globalization.\u00a0 She has also served on community non-profit and for-profit organizations including Ada Developers Academy, NordVPN, Northwest Tech Equity Initiative (NWTEI) and OPTYVA, a social purpose organization with a business sustainability focus.</p><p>In November 2021, Tammarrian left her position as Snap\u2019s first Inclusive Engineering Director to redirect her energy to developing methodologies that promote and facilitate global relational healing; healing that will lead to a sustainable, healthy planet and future for us humans.\u00a0 Ultimately, her goal is to systematically embed these successful methodologies into emerging and evolving technologies.</p><p>As a solo nomad today, Tammarrian is enjoying meeting and connecting with people and land around our world. You\u2019ll likely find her on an urban or nature hike, in some body of water or giving much love to a stranger\u2019s dog.</p><blockquote><p>\"We really have to be aware of what is the impact of the product that we're building on our communities beyond the typical metrics that we use to say that we're being successful. So for example, we talk a lot about success being financial, right? It's a profit. How are we profiting? And that also hinges upon everything from our engagement metrics, the visits, the retention, the click-through rate. Whatever your product is, what is it that you're measuring to say that you're building and retaining a community of people and you're growing your business? We're all familiar with that, and I think what I'm inviting us to do as engineering leaders across our industry is to shift the currency of success and to bring in an entirely different currency.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Tammarrian Rogers \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Join us at ELC Annual 2023!</h2><p>ELC Annual is our flagship conference for engineering leaders.
