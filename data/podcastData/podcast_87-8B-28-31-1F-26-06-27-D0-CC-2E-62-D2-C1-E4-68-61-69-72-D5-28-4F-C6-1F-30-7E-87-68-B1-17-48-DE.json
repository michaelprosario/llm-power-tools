    "Title": "Moving up a level of abstraction with serverless on MongoDB Atlas and AWS",
    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>The history of computing has been a story of moving up levels of abstraction: from hard-coding algorithms and directly manipulating memory addresses with assembly languages to using more natural language constructs in high-level general purpose languages to abstracting the hardware of the computer in cloud compute. Now serverless functions take that abstraction even further. We\u2019ve made the algorithms that process data simple and natural; MongoDB wants to do the same for how we persist data.\u00a0</p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we chat with Andrew Davidson, SVP Products at MongoDB, about how they\u2019re turning a database into a fully-managed service that developers can use in a more natural way. Along the way, we discuss how the cost bottleneck has moved from the storage media to developers\u2019 minds, how greater abstractions can enable developers, and how to get insights from production data faster.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Episode notes</strong></p><p>Try <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-on-aws\">MongoDB Atlas on AWS</a> for free.</p><p>You can get started with MongoDB Atlas directly from the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-pp445qepfdy34?trk=06a991a4-9506-4980-93d2-87b5b6e6f953&sc_channel=el\">AWS Marketplace</a>.\u00a0</p><p>If you\u2019re at a startup, you can take advantage of their <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/startups\">special offer for startups</a>.\u00a0</p><p>The community edition of their classic database is <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community\">available to download</a> as well.\u00a0</p><p>If you\u2019re looking to learn a thing or two before diving in, check out <a href=\"https://learn.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB University</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Our thanks to Great Question badge winner <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/283863/derek-%e6%9c%95%e6%9c%83%e5%8a%9f%e5%a4%ab\">Derek \u6715\u6703\u529f\u592b</a> for asking <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10168034/how-can-i-reverse-an-array-in-javascript-without-using-libraries\">How can I reverse an array in JavaScript without using libraries?</a> You know the rarest kung fu of all: asking great questions.</p>\n",
