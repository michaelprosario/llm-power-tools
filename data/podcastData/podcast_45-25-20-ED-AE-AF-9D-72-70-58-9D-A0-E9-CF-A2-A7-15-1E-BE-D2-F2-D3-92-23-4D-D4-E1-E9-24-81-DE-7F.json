    "Description": "\n        <p>KiwiCo founder Sandra Oh Lin took an after-school pastime and turned it into a multi-million-dollar business. After quitting a high-powered job in tech, she dived into doing after-school projects with her kids, like making puppets out of Styrofoam or combining baking soda and vinegar to see what happens. When she discovered that other parents liked these projects too, she decided to create a subscription box company that sent out science and crafts kits every month. She gathered kids in her garage to test-market her ideas, and pitched her plan over and over to investors in Silicon Valley, where her car was \u201cthe only minivan in the parking lot.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;Today KiwiCo is the leading subscription box for kids, and has shipped over 50 million crates worldwide.</p><p>This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson with music by Ramtin Arablouei.&nbsp;</p><p>It was edited by Neva Grant with research help from Carla Esteves.
