    "Description": "\n        <p>How much is turnover costing your business? We bet you\u2019re spending a lot more than you'd like. The problem is, most businesses hire based only on skills. They forget to look at a person's talent, passion and mission. In this episode of The EntreLeadership Podcast, we interview bestselling author Ken Coleman. He explains how you can help your team discover the stuff that gives them the juice. Then George Kamel sits down with Ramsey Solutions Chief Creative Officer Luke LeFevre. He shares an incredible story of how he helped his former assistant find the right seat on the bus and the plan he followed to navigate that conversation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/shows/the-entreleadership-podcast\"> <em>The EntreLeadership Podcast</em></a></p><p>Preorder Ken Coleman\u2019s brand-new book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xi6vlk\"><em>From Paycheck to Purpose</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3haAMxR\">Learn more about EntreLeadership Summit</a></p><p>Recent episode: <a href=\"https://apple.co/3lsIxlp\">Why People Are Leaving Your Company with Shawn Davis</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qwUypG\">Download The EntreLeader's Guide to Hiring</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3aK6crS\">Schedule a call with Tim, the Producer</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Learn more about the offers from our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2RnQVWk\">EntreLeadership Partners</a>:</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3epUiVK\">BELAY</a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https://lp.gravysolutions.io/entreleadership\">Gravy</a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.hitedigital.com/entreleadership/\">Hite Digital</a></p>\n      ",
