    "Description": "<p>Today\u2019s guest is a legend in the world of podcasts. His name is Dave Jackson and he describes himself using these five words: \u201cI love to help people.\u201d He is the Director of Education with Libsyn and the founder of the School of Podcasting, his own business, podcast and a published author. Dave definitely has a servant heart, he shared that as a child he grew up understanding how his mom (his superhero) could make the meals and home feel provided for. His dad was a truck driver and on the road a lot. He missed him at the 3-legged race and wanted to help others feel included as he watched other children run a race with their dads. This desire to help others feel important, seen and heard is what led him to start his own business His take on what 2030 might look like is that he is very worried how people will have dialogue with one another when we have become so accustomed to a digital world behind a screen. He believes that human skills will be at a prime demand because technology is advancing so quickly. Dave stated that he believes that AI should be called Assisted intelligence, not artificial intelligence We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.\u00a0\u00a0 The Intern Whisperer Podcast\u00a0is brought to you by\u00a0Employers 4 Change - Increasing diversity through #Skills based #DiversityEquityInclusion #recruitment and #management for #interns and #employees alike.
