    "Description": "<p>Everyone in the community was surprised by <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/just-out-of-the-box-chatgpt-causing-waves-of-talk-concern/\">ChatGPT last year</a>, which a web service responded to any and all user questions <a href=\"https://archive.ph/2023.01.25-131857/https://fortune.com/longform/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-microsoft/\">with a surprising fluidity</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>ChatGPT is a variant of the powerful <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/openais-gpt-3-makes-big-leap-forward-for-natural-language-processing/\">GPT-3 large language model</a> created by OpenAI, a company owned by Microsoft. It is still a demo though it is pretty clear that this type of generative AI will be rapidly commercialized. Indeed Microsoft is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/microsoft-ai-chatgpt-bing.html\">embedding the generative AI in its Bing Search service</a>, and Google <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/06/tech/google-bard-chatgpt-rival/index.html\">is building a rival offering</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>So what are smaller businesses to do to ensure their messages are heard to these machine learning giants?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For this latest podcast from The New Stack, we discussed these issues with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanejohnston/\">Ryan Johnston</a>, chief marketing officer for <a href=\"https://writer.com/\">Writer</a>. Writer has enjoyed an early success in generative AI technologies. The company's service is dedicated to a single mission: making sure its customers' content adheres to the guidelines set in place.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This can include features such as ensuring the language in the copy matches the company's own designated terminology, or making sure that a piece of content covers all the required topic points, or even that a press release has quotes that are not out of scope with the project mission itself.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In short, the service promises \"consistently on-brand content at scale,\" Johnston said. \"It's not taking away my creativity. But it is doing a great job of figuring out how to create content for me at a faster pace, [content] that actually sounds like what I want it to sound like.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For our conversation, we first delved into how the company was started, its value proposition (\"what is it used for?\") and what role that AI plays in the company's offering. We also delve a bit into the technology stack Writer deploys to offer these services, as well as what material the Writer may require from their customers themselves to make the service work.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For the second part of our conversation, we turn our attention to how other companies (that are not search giants) can get their message across in the land of large language models, and maybe even find a few new sources of AI-generated value along the way. And, for those public-facing businesses dealing with Google and Bing, we chat about how they should they refine their own <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/does-jamstack-or-wordpress-handle-seo-requirements-better/\">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) strategies to be best represented in these large models?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>One point to consider: While AI can generate a lot of pretty convincing text, you still need a human in the loop to oversee the results, Johnston advised.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"We are augmenting content teams copywriters to do what they do best, just even better. So we're scaling the mundane parts of the process that you may not love. We are helping you get a first draft on paper when you've got writer's block,\" Johnston said. \"But at the end of the day, our belief is there needs to be a great writer in the driver's seat. [You] should never just be fully reliant on AI to produce things that you're going to immediately take to market.\"</p>\n",
