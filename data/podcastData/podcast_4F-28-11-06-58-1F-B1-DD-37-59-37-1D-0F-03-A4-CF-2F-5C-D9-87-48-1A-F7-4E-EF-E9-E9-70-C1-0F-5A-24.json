    "Description": "<p>Tik Tok has been accused of spying on users and siphoning up their data, although it's important to point out the same criticism has been leveled at many American tech giant's apps and web services. In working to address security flaws, it seemed that Tik Tok programming \u00a0was just as often <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/technology/tiktok-security-flaws.html\">sloppy as malicious</a>.\u00a0</p><p>All that hasn't stopped reports from surfacing that Microsoft might be wiling to pay as much as $30 billion to acquire Tik Tok, at which point <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/microsoft-has-one-year-to-transfer-tiktoks-code-to-the-us.html\">it intends to</a> \"transfer all of TikTok\u2019s code from China to the U.S. within one year.\" This code just needs a supportive home.\u00a0</p><p>Speaking of moving to new digs, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21277254/tech-silicon-valley-remote-work-exodus-facebook-google-coronavirus-future\">a recent survey</a>, two out of three techies in the San Francisco Bay area say they are considering moving if their employers allow it.\u00a0</p><p>Will we see the rise of a complex system of salaries that fluctuate not just by rank and performance, but by proximity to the home office?\u00a0<br /><br />Will Silicon Valley's once unshakable grip on the cutting edge of startup culture and product acumen start to wane if developers flee for remote working locales in more affordable areas? Can you turn back the clock once they can acquire bigger homes or enjoy more of the great outdoors during a pandemic that doesn't yet have a firm end date.\u00a0</p>\n",
