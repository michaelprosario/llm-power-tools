    "Description": "<p>Greg Czajkowski (SVP of Engineering @ Snowflake) shares some of the secrets he\u2019s learned about great teams! We discuss the power of eliminating hierarchy, \u201cgoing direct,\u201d reducing energy dissipation in your team, removing friction in your org, and creating \u201chigher innovation per time unit.\u201d Plus dilemmas balancing velocity & quality, what to do when team size is used as proxy for power, and how to know your eng org is operating at peak output!</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/grzegorz-czajkowski-123213a1/\">GREG CZAJKOWSKI</a></h2><p>Grzegorz (Greg) Czajkowski, a distributed systems and organizations scaling expert, is Senior Vice President of Engineering and Support at Snowflake. Prior to Snowflake, Greg spent 13 years at Google, where he was VP of Engineering responsible for a broad portfolio of Google Cloud data analytics and machine learning products and for internal services addressing data analytics needs of all of Google\u2019s businesses. Before Google, Greg spent six years at Sun Microsystems, working on Java runtime environments and operating systems. Greg has a PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University, an MBA from UC Berkeley, and an undergraduate degree from AGH Krakow, Poland. He holds over 50 patents.</p><blockquote><p>\"What I learned at Snowflake is\u00a0 really practicing \"Go Direct.\"\u00a0 If there's something you don't like, you'd like to fix, you have to go to the person who made the decision.</p><p>Usually you learn much more about the decision. There's a good conversation. Sometimes you convince the owner of the decision to do something different.</p><p>I think nothing beats going direct, because any other means of trying to change a certain decision, certain point of view indirectly, is ineffective causes, frictions, and ultimately energy gets dissipated.</p><p>- Greg Czajkowski \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Our in-person conference <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">ELC Annual</a> returns 10/27-28!</strong></h2><p>Learn from 60+ of the best engineering leaders in the industry / Critical insights on leadership, career and technology / Plus tons of experiences optimized for deep conversations & meaningful connections - all to help you build your support network!</p><p><strong><i>Don't miss out on being part of the biggest celebration of engineering leadership of the year!</i></strong></p><h3>Grab your ticket HERE: <strong><a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">sfelc.com/annual2022</a></strong></h3><hr /><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"http://plusplus.co/elc\">PlusPlus</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://plusplus.co/elc\">PlusPlus</a> is an all-in-one technical onboarding and internal knowledge platform that fast-tracks productivity.</p><h3><strong>Learn more & sign up at</strong> <a href=\"https://plusplus.co/elc/\"><strong>plusplus.co/elc</strong></a></h3><h2>Check out our friends at <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\">Shortcut</a>!</h2><p><a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>Shortcut</strong></a> is an issue tracker that offers all the functionality, without most of the complexity making it easier for you to plan, collaborate, build, and measure success.</p><p><i><strong>Right now, listeners of our show can get 2-months free on any paid plan.</strong></i></p><h3><strong>Learn more & sign up at</strong> <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>shortcut.com/elc</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Qualities and characteristics Greg's observed in great teams (2:02)</li><li>Why Greg joined Snowflake (3:46)</li><li>\u201cGo direct\u201d and other secrets to great teams (5:27)</li><li>Balancing \"go direct\" and the chain of command (7:35)</li><li>Eliminating hierarchy (9:21)</li><li>Creating higher innovation per time unit in engineering teams (11:21)</li><li>How do you know your eng org is operating at peak output?
