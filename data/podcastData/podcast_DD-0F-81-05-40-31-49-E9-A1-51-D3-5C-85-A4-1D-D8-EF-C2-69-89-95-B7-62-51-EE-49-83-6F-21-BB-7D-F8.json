    "Description": "<p>Stephen Rose is back and in a new role! Richard chats with Stephen about his work on OneDrive for Business, which is one of the great cloud-enabling products out there today. Stephen talks about the automation in OneDrive for Business with Office 365 that gets rid of big email attachments, instead automatically embedding a link to the file into the email - the file itself lives in OneDrive for Business the whole time! The conversation also turns to the sophisticated security models available through the cloud with OneDrive for Business, that focus on preventative behaviors, not just reactionary. File storage has never been more interesting!</p>\n",
