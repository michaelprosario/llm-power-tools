Joseph Hamer - Bio as Submitted <p>Inspiring children to become aware of their greatest potential is why Joseph chose the path of an educator. Mr. Hamer is known by his colleagues for creating a safe and uplifting environment for his students to continuously learn and grow. To further expand his ability to positively impact children, Joseph is currently pursuing his master's degree in administration. After beginning his own journey of awareness in 2017, Joseph started teaching his students how to monitor and manage their emotions using mindfulness. The activities made such an incredible impact on his classroom community each year that he knew he needed to develop a tool for teachers and parents to replicate the results. Thus, Joseph began his writing career to empower parents, teachers, and their children.</p> <p>Website: <a class=\"text-blue underline\" href= \"http://www.brainawakes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">http://www.BrainAwakes.com</a></p> <p>Twitter: @<a href= \"https://www.twitter.com/MrJosephHamer\">MrJosephHamer</a></p> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
