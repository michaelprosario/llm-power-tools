    "Description": "<p>You can change one simple thing to help transform your classroom. Change is a decision, not to leap forward but to take one small step and then another. Today, Pam Moran finishes up our series encouraging us to take small steps that make a big difference. She also helps us understand the mistake we make when we look too big picture and forget the small things we can do. Thank you, Pam for your time and wisdom and I hope everyone has enjoyed this four-part series with a truly remarkable educator. <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e246%20\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e246</a></p> <p>Matific is Today's Sponsor:\u00a0The <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/math\">US Matific Games</a> are coming this February.
