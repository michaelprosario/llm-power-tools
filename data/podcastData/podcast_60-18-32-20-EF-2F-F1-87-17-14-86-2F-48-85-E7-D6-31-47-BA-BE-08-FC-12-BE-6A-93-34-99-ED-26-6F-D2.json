    "Description": "<p>Young children have many different ability levels with math concepts. Understandably, kindergarten and elementary teachers need to reach every student where they are on their learning journey, but it isn't always easy. Dr. Carol Ann Tomlinson, an expert on the topic, gives an overview of how to differentiate math instruction with younger students.\u00a0</p> <p>See notes and transcript:\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e793\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e793</a></p> <p>Sponsor: Thank you, <a href= \"https://go.espark.app/CoolCatTeacher\">eSpark</a> for sponsoring today\u2019s show. eSpark is a differentiation and intervention tool that helps teachers of kindergarten through grade five save time by providing ready-to-go, standards-based reading and math activities that students love. eSpark is free for teachers. Each Quest includes a pre-quiz, framing videos, instructional videos, practice activities, critical thinking challenges, a post-quiz, and an optional student recording. I love that for activities to remain in the eSpark catalog that it must have a high student engagement rating based on a student-chosen thumbs-up or thumbs-down. You can even import NWEA or STAR data to give students a more differentiated experience from the first log on. Oh and did I say it is free for teachers!
