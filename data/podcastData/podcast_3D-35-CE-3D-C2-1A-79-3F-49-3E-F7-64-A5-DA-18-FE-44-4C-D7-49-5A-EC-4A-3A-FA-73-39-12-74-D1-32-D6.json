    "Description": "<p>The conversation is about Artificial Intelligence. Is it helpful? Should it be welcomed in schools? Should it be blocked? Today's three guests are expert authors of the newly released <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KfikRN\">The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education</a>.\u00a0 We need to get practical, past the hype, and work to do that in this show.</p> <p>This is also episode 800. We always celebrate when arriving at such milestone episodes so I have my son, John, share the stats for the first eight hundred episodes and we have a little fun. I hope this extended episode serves as a helpful addition to the AI discussion.</p> <p>Also note, and ironically so, that due to the extended nature of this episode and that we have four speakers, the AI tools I use to write the transcript had a bit of a meltdown, and I've had to apply a significant amount of human intelligence to the transcript which delayed this episode to Thursday. This podcast does come out on Mondays and future episodes will be the ten minutes, but this conversation is so important.</p> <p>Show Notes, Full Transcript, and Bios : <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e800\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e800</a></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Sponsor:\u00a0This is financial literacy month!
