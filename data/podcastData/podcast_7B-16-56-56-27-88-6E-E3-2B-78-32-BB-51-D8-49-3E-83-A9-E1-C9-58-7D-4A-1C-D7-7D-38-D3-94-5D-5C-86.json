    "Description": "<p>Richard talks to Jeremy Thake about the move of Sharepoint into the Cloud. The conversation starts off with a bit of a history lesson and how Sharepoint has taken a few twists and turns along the way offering different programming models, and really struggling with what it is actually good at. Jeremy discusses how moving Sharepoint to the Cloud is really about shaking off some of the baggage of the past to focus on the core goodness in Sharepoint. It's not just about paying by the user, it's also about reinforcing good governance in Sharepoint. Whether you're moving to the cloud or not, Jeremy has some great thoughts about creating sustainable Sharepoint environments.</p>\n",
