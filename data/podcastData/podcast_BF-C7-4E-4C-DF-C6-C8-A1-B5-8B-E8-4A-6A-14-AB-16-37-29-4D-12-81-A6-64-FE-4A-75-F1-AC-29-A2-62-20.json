    "Description": "<p>Recently, I came across a story that my mother had adapted when she was a teacher to use to teach students about caring for others who had done things for them. During this time of Thanksgiving and approaching Christmas, it is easy for many of us (kids included) to become self-absorbed and to forget those who have done so much. So, feel free to use today's story as you want but also to use it as a personal challenge to make a list of those this season who deserve your extra attention and notice.</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e586\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e586</a>\u00a0</p>  Sponsor:\u00a0The U.S. Toyota Dream Car Art Contest invites youth, ages 4-15, to submit their original hand-drawn artworks that answer the question, \u201cIf you could design a car to make the world a better place, what would it look like?\u201d Artwork submissions for this free youth art contest are accepted this year from November 1, 2019, through January 31, 2020. Teachers can download a FREE K-12 standards-aligned lesson plan on car design that includes STEM concepts and art. Go to\u00a0<a href= \"http://www.toyotadreamcarusa.com/CoolCat\">www.ToyotaDreamCarUSA.com/CoolCat</a>\u00a0to download artwork guidelines, an entry form, official rules, and the lesson plan today. Encourage your students to create Toyota Dream Car artworks today.  <p>\u00a0</p> Your Challenge: Plan Ahead of Gratitude <p>Your challenge today is to find someone who needs and deserves attention, respect, and care this season and to give it to them. I also encourage you to help your students have empathy, love, and gratitude towards others who pour into their lives. If you want to use this story or play it, feel free but it is certainly one you can adapt.</p> <p>You can tell stories to students to teach points and ideas. In fact, I would argue that stories are one of the best, most timeless ways to teach. I love to find good stories and tell them to my students to make them think or teach a point.</p>",
