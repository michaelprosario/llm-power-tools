Maulie is passionate about her customers, innovation, technology, inclusivity, and cheese pizza.</p><blockquote><p>\"Even if a customer is very clear on a solution that they want... \"I need an AI ML solution that does X, Y, Z.\" The question that I use often is \"Tell me more about that? Like, what is instigating this need?\" Think of the next question that'll kind of get you closer and closer to the source, or the root of the issue.\"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Maulie Dass \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Maulie shares the \u201cexpensive lessons\u201d she learned while designing her first microchip (2:00)</li><li>How learning and curiosity guided Maulie\u2019s career across engineering, sales, and innovation (6:19)</li><li>What engineering leaders can learn from sales (11:07)</li><li>\u201cSeek to understand first\u201d & questions Maulie uses to empathize (17:30)</li><li>When should leaders stop asking questions?
