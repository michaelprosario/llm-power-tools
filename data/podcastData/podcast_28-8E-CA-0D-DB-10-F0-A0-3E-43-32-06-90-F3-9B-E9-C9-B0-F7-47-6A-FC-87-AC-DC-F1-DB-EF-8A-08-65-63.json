    "Description": "\n        <p><em>Ugh, another meeting!</em> Do you know the feeling? We sure do. We\u2019ve sat through our share of bad meetings. But would you believe we actually <em>love</em> meetings now?</p> <p>It\u2019s true. We got so sick of lousy meetings that we decided to do something about it.</p> <p>When we founded this company, we determined that meetings were going to be something more than a necessary evil. We wanted to make meetings productive and engaging, like they were meant to be.</p> <p>So we created a meeting rhythm and cadence that ensures we have just the right number of meetings, that they all have a clear purpose, and that they don\u2019t get bogged down or pulled off track.</p> <p>And it works! Our meetings are enjoyable because we all know why we\u2019re there, that the outcome is important, and it\u2019ll be worth our time. We love meetings\u2014and <em>you can too!</em></p> <p>In this episode, we show you how to structure your meetings for maximum engagement and results. We\u2019ve also got two free tools that will make it <em>much</em> easier to structure your meetings.
