    "Description": "<p>Today I'm talking with programmer legend Jeff Atwood. Jeff co-founded Stack Overflow with Joel Spolsky back in 2008. And software development has never been the same.</p> <p>Jeff also co-founded Discourse, a beloved forum tool used by Apple, Roblox, and of course the freeCodeCamp community. And Jeff is a prolific writer through his blog, Coding Horror.</p> <p>I met up with Jeff at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area, and interviewed him in the room where he builds so many of his software projects.</p> <p>We talked about software development and community building. Among other things, he shared his thoughts on Large Language Models, VR, and Self-Driving Cars.</p> <p>If you dig this podcast, be sure to leave us a review. I'm excited to read any feedback you have for me.</p> <p>And tell your friends. It's a huge help for us. We're still early days with The freeCodeCamp Podcast. I'm interviewing so many other inspiring developers in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Jeff's Blog, Coding Horror: https://blog.codinghorror.com/</p>",
