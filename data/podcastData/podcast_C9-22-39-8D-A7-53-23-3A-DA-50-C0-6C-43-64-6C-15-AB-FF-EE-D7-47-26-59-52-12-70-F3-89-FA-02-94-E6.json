    "Description": "<p>Earlier this year, the Python Software Foundation announced the creation of the Developer in Residence role. The first Visionary Sponsors of the PSF have provided funding for this new role for one year. What development responsibilities does this job address? This week on the show, we talk to previous guest \u0141ukasz Langa about becoming the first CPython Developer in Residence.</p>\n<p>We talk about how the first months in this role are shaping up. \u0141ukasz discusses the need to address the backlog of open issues and pull requests. He also talks about how he is working to help the project&rsquo;s volunteers move their contributions forward. </p>\n<p>We cover his PyCon 2021 talk about generating real-time FM audio synthesis in Python. He also shares his experience developing a similar synthesis engine for an embedded hardware project.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/speech-recognition-python/\">Speech Recognition With Python</a></p>\n<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll cover the fundamentals of speech recognition with Python.
