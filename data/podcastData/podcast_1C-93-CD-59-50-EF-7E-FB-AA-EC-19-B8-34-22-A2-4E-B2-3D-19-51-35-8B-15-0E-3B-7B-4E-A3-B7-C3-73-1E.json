    "Description": "<p>Rust has maintained its place among the top 15 programming languages and has been the most admired language for nine consecutive years. In a New Stack Makers podcast, Joel Marcey, director of technology at the Rust Foundation, discussed the language's growing importance, including initiatives to improve its security, performance, and adoption in various domains. While Rust is widely used in systems and backend programming, it\u2019s also gaining traction in embedded systems, safety-critical applications, game development, and even the Linux kernel.</p><p>Marcey highlighted Rust\u2019s strengths as a safe and fast systems language, noting its use on the web through WebAssembly (Wasm), though adoption there is still early. He also addressed Rust vs. Go, explaining that Rust excels in performance-critical applications. Marcey discussed recent updates, such as Rust 1.81, and project goals for 2024, which include a new edition and async improvements.</p><p>He also touched on government interest in Rust, including DARPA\u2019s initiative to convert C code to Rust, and the Rust Security Initiative, aimed at maintaining the language\u2019s strong security reputation.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Rust\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-case-for-rust-as-the-future-of-javascript-infrastructure/ \">Could Rust be the Future of JavaScript Infrastructure?</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/rust-growing-fastest-but-javascript-reigns-supreme/ \">Rust Growing Fastest, But JavaScript Reigns Supreme</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/rust-vs-zig-in-reality-a-somewhat-friendly-debate/ \">Rust vs. Zig in Reality: A (Somewhat) Friendly Debate</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
