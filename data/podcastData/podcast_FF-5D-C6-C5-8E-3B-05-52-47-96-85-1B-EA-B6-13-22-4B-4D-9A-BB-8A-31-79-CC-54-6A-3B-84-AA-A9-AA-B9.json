    "Description": "<p>In this episode of The New Stack\u2019s On the Road show at Open Source Summit in Austin, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/webbbrown\">Webb Brown</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.kubecost.com\">KubeCost</a>, talked with The New Stack about opening up the black box on how much Kubernetes is really costing.\u00a0<br /><br />Whether we\u2019re talking about cloud costs in general or the costs specifically associated with Kubernetes, the problem teams complain about is lack of visibility. This is a cliche complaint about AWS, but it gets even more complicated once Kubernetes enters the picture. \u201cNow everything\u2019s distributed, everything\u2019s shared,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt becomes much harder to understand and break down these costs. And things just tend to be way more dynamic.\u201d The ability of pods to spin up and down is a key advantage of Kubernetes and brings resilience, but it also makes it harder to understand how much it costs to run a specific feature.\u00a0<br /><br />And costs aren\u2019t just about money, either. Even with unlimited money, looking at cost information can provide important information about performance issues, reliability or availability. \u201cOur founding team was at Google working on infrastructure monitoring, we view costs as a really important part of this equation, but only one part of the equation, which is you\u2019re really looking at the relationship between performance and cost,\u201d Brown said. \u201cEven with unlimited budged, you would still care about resourcing and configuration, because it can really impact reliability and availability of your services.\u201d</p>\n",
