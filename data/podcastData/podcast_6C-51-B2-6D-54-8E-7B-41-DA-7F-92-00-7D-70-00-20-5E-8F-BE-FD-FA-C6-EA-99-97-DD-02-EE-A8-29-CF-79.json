    "Description": "<p>From the outside, it seemed like Andy Dunn was living the dream. His menswear company, Bonobos, was acquired by Walmart for $310 million in 2017 \u2014 the same year he married the love of his life, Manuela. Of course, Andy\u2019s entrepreneurial journey wasn\u2019t without its challenges. Under the surface were much darker struggles that he largely kept hidden\u2026</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Andy returns to the show to talk to Guy about his new book, Burn Rate: Launching a Startup and Losing My Mind. In this radically honest memoir, Andy finally opens up about the struggle with bipolar disorder that nearly cost him everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out Andy\u2019s book here: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Rate-Launching-Startup-Losing/dp/0593238265\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Rate-Launching-Startup-Losing/dp/0593238265</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Listen to Andy\u2019s How I Built This interview from 2019: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/686640146/bonobos-andy-dunn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/686640146/bonobos-andy-dunn</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
