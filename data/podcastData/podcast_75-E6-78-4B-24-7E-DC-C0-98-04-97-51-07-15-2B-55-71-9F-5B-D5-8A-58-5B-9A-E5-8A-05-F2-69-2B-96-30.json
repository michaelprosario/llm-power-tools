    "Description": "<p>Scott Norton and Mark Ramadan were only college students when they created Sir Kensington\u2019s, a&nbsp;$140-million-dollar condiment brand \u2013 with a backstory that\u2019s completely made up.</p><p>These days, it seems like every brand \u2013 every start-up \u2013 is trying to tell a story about its authentic and humble beginnings. Scott and Mark went in the opposite direction when they had the idea to create a gourmet ketchup in 2008. They wanted to take on a juggernaut: Heinz. So, to stand out, they told a story about their ketchup that differentiated it from Heinz in every way. Sir Kensington was a fictional luminary of imperial Britain who invented his eponymous ketchup one night while dining with Catherine the Great. And the<em> true </em>story of how Scott and Mark grew&nbsp;and then sold the company to Unilever \u2013 it\u2019s a real yarn in its own right.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Andrea Bruce.</p><p>Our engineers were Gilly Moon and Maggie Luthar.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is brought to you in part by Canva, the easy-to-use online design platform for presentations, social posts, videos, websites, and more.
