    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with the founder of PyImageSearch.com, Adrian Rosebrock, who gives us a great overview of the space of computer vision. You will learn what computer vision was in the past, what it is now, and most importantly, what it will be in the future and what you need to prepare for if you're interested in computer vision. You will also learn about OpenCV and how to quickly get started with it as it is one of the most popular libraries and tools for computer vision in the world right now.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/255\">www.superdatascience.com/255</a></p>\n      ",
