    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Astrophysicist and Online Data Science Instructor, Sam Hinton. You will hear about the Lindau Nobel Laureates meeting, where he met Nobel Prize winners and you will also hear about his appearance on the Survivor TV show. You will learn about quantum mechanics. You will also learn about the course he launched in Python for Statistical Analysis, as well as going in-depth on hypothesis testing. You will hear about Python versus R, statistical significance, why p-value of 0.5 is bad, Bayesian statistics, and what is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/303\">www.superdatascience.com/303</a></p>\n      ",
