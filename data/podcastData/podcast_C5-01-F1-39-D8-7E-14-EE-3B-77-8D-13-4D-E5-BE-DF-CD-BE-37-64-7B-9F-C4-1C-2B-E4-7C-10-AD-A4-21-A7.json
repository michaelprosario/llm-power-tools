    "Description": "<p>Some students just seem to \"live\" in the principal's office. How do we help those students change their behavior and connect with their classmates and teachers? Today, award-winning principal, Andy Jacks, says that he spent most of his younger years in the principal's office. Some reached him and some did not, but it has shaped the discipline practices in his school. Certainly, Andy's \"non-negotiables\" when it comes to discipline may challenge the status quo in many schools. As you discuss discipline and reaching children, however, he has some important points to help all educators be more empathetic to the student who just can't seem to stay out of trouble.</p> <p><em>Note from Vicki: This week is a whole week of motivational podcast episodes.
