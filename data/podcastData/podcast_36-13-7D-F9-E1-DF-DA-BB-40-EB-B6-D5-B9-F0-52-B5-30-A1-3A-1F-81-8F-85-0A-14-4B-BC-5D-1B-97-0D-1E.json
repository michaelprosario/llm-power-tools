    "Description": "<p>This year over 80,000 respondents took the time to share their feedback on the tools and trends that are shaping software development.</p><p>We learned a lot about the way developers learn. \ufeffFor the rising cohort of coders under the age of 18, online resources like videos and blogs are more popular than books and school combined, a statistic that doesn\u2019t hold for any of our other age cohorts. \ufeff\ufeff</p><p>Roughly a third of respondents responded to our question on mental health. This is twice the percentage that offered feedback in 2020 and may reflect a growing awareness of the importance of mental health\u2019s and the impact of the ongoing pandemic.</p><p>Another trend that may be linked to the pandemic is work status. We see a greater percentage of respondents working part-time or in school, while those indicating full time employment decreased. This may reflect the effects of the pandemic, which saw workers from all industries stepping back and reevaluating their relationship to a five day work week and in-person employment.</p><p>Check out the full results of the 2021 Dev Survey <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021?_ga=2.192349162.1902744783.1627913944-590698376.1564583819\">here</a>.</p>\n",
