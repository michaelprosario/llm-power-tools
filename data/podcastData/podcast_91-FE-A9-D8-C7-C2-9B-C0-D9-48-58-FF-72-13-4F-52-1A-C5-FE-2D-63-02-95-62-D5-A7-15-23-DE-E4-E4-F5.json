    "Description": "<p>What does Windows want for Christmas? Richard chats with Paul Thurrott about the crazy year that Windows has had and what 2025 holds. Paul starts with the Ignite keynote that focused on Windows being an open platform - which sounds funny on the surface, but has some logic to it! Security is a key part of that story, which brings up the issues around Crowdstrike and the Secure Future Initiative. And then there's Windows 10 going out of support in 2025 - what choices do you have going forward? Two grumpy old men ring out the year \u2013 have a great holiday season!</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative\">Secure Future Initiative</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/11/19/windows-security-and-resiliency-protecting-your-business/\">Windows Security and Resiliency</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/GS06?source=sessions\">What's new in Windows Security, Productivity, and Cloud</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/whats-new-windows-server-2025?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Windows Server 2025</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/end-of-support?r=1\">Windows 10 End of Support</a></li></ul><p>Recorded December 5, 2024</p>\n",
