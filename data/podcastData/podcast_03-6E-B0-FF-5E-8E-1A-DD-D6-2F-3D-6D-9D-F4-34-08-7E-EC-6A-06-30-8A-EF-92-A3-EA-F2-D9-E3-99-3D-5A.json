So you're not really getting the 30, 40, 50% discount.\u00a0</p><p>So I call these reservations or these look forward commitments a necessary evil because... customers HAVE to do it in many cases. They don't have an alternative. But at the same time, it's not good for the business!\u201d</p><p>- Leon Kuperman \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Our in-person conference <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">ELC Annual</a> returns 10/27-28!</strong></h2><p>Learn from 60+ of the best engineering leaders in the industry / Critical insights on leadership, career and technology / Plus tons of experiences optimized for deep conversations & meaningful connections - all to help you build your support network!</p><p><strong><i>Don't miss out on being part of the biggest celebration of engineering leadership of the year!</i></strong></p><h3>Grab your ticket HERE: <strong><a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">sfelc.com/annual2022</a></strong></h3><hr /><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"http://jellyfish.co/elc\">Jellyfish</a></h2><p>Want to learn where engineering teams are investing their time and resources?
