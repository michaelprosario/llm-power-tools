    "Description": "\n        <p>If you tend to blame yourself for your bad habits, <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author James Clear says you\u2019re wasting your time. Not only does such behavior create feelings of guilt\u2014which, by the way, are pretty counterproductive\u2014but it also does nothing to get you any closer to achieving your goals. Tune in to hear James explain the real cause of bad habits (translation: You\u2019re off the hook!), as well as some super easy strategies to help you break them and replace them with good ones. We think you\u2019ll be amazed at how even the tiniest change can lead to really remarkable results.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/podcast\">entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p>Buy the book and get free bonuses:\u00a0<a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits\"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/\">Download a chapter</a>\u00a0of\u00a0<em>Atomic Habits</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://sn251.infusionsoft.app/app/form/form-opt-in-episode302\">7-Day Plan to Triple Your Productivity</a></p> <p>Free worksheet from Belay Solutions:\u00a0<a href=\"https://belaysolutions.com/5things\">Things to Delegate to Save 15 Hours This Week</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
