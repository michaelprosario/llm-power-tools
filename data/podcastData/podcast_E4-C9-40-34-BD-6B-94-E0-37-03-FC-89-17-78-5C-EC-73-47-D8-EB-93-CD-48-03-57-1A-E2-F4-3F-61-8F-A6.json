    "Description": "\n        <p>Are our passwords safe, even with the increasing accessibility of quantum computing? Florian Neukart, Chief Product Officer at Terra Quantum AG, thinks so. In this episode, he outlines the three key elements of quantum-safe security. He speaks to Jon Krohn about the resourceful applications of quantum computing and workarounds for the demands of quantum computing on operational times and cooling systems. And if you\u2019re interested in making the switch to quantum computing from machine learning, he also explores what you need (and don\u2019t need) to make change happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?
