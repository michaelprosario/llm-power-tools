    "Description": "<p>In a talk that's by turns heartbreaking and hilarious, writer and podcaster Nora McInerny shares her hard-earned wisdom about life and death. Her candid approach to something that will, let's face it, affect us all, is as liberating as it is gut-wrenching. Most powerfully, she encourages us to shift how we approach grief. \"A grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again,\" she says. \"They're going to move forward. But that doesn't mean that they've moved on.\"</p><br><p>This episode originally aired on December 25, 2019.</p><p>Want to help shape TED's shows going forward?
