    "Description": "\n        <p><a href=\"https://storybrand.com/workshop/\">Donald Miller</a>, best-selling author and CEO of StoryBrand, knows your most powerful marketing tool has nothing to do with a big budget. The most effective marketing comes down to one simple thing: the right words. Note: cute or clever ones <em>never</em> work. And the doubled, tripled\u2014and even quadrupled\u2014revenues of the more than 3,000 companies he\u2019s worked with are all the proof we need. Join us to learn how to clarify your brand message so people will actually listen. Donald joined us last week in Nashville for <a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/ems\">EntreLeadership Master Series</a>\u2014and now you can watch him in action with our attendees on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/entreleadership\"><strong>EntreLeadership YouTube channel</strong></a>.
