    "Description": "When developer Aidan Feldman had a line of people waiting for their turn to get coding help from him, he decided to try a different format. Instead of one-on-one tutoring, how about open office hours for anyone coding to come together and work on their skills? And that was the beginning of Hacker Hours. Aidan tells us how he\u2019s built Hacker Hours over the past few years, and how he manages to keep the community accessible and incredibly welcoming. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
