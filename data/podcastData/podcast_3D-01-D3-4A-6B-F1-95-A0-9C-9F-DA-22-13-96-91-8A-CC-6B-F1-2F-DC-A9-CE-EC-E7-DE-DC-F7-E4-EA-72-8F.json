    "Description": "  Agile in Construction: Managing The Network of Promises in Lean Construction, with Luca Cotta Ramusino <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Read the full Show Notes and search through the world's largest audio library on Agile and Scrum directly on the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast website: <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes\"> http://bit.ly/SMTP_ShowNotes</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Luca defines success in Lean construction through two critical metrics from the Last Planner Method: PPC (Percentage of Plan Complete) and RNC (Reasons for Not Completing). Success means creating reliable promises in what he describes as construction's \"network of promises.\" <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_construction\"> The Last Planner Method</a>  removes layers of management by having those closest to the work do the planning themselves. PPC measures how reliable your promises are\u2014similar to Scrum's definition of \"done\"\u2014while RNC identifies where problems concentrate, typically in 2-3 areas. Both the work provider and receiver must agree on what \"complete\" means for these metrics to be meaningful.</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Reflect and Disinfect <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Luca developed this daily retrospective practice where people share what was interesting about their work day without formal meetings. Inspired by both Scrum retrospectives and Toyota's focus on reflection and introspection, this 15-minute format answers three questions: what should we continue doing, what should we stop doing, and what should we start doing? The practice emphasizes that teams need moments to stop and think back in order to improve how they work. The informal nature makes it accessible to construction crews who might resist traditional meeting formats.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How reliable are the promises your team makes, and what patterns do you see in the reasons they're not kept?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
