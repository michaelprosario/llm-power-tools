    "Description": "When it was time for lunch, the other students ate and got to know each other while Tina Lee searched for a place to nurse her baby. The only one she found in that coding workshop was the cold, dark, filthy room where the company's developers slept - at least that's what it looked like. And she sat, frustrated that in a workshop that was meant to be inclusive, she still felt very much alone. So she started Mother Coders, the tech education program designed for mothers who want to gain technical skills. We talk about the challenges of being a mom learning to code, how organizers can make their tech events more mom-friendly, and how to make coding more accessible to all mothers.
