    "Description": "<p>We discuss the dynamics & challenges behind building out your data engineering function with Taylor Murphy (Head of Product & Data @ Meltano). Taylor also shares his recommendations for collaborating in multi-stakeholder environments, the relationship between the data team & engineering, why you should run your data team like a product team, gaining buy-in around the ROI of data, and what it\u2019s like being a company\u2019s first data eng hire. Featuring guest co-host/community member John Wang (Director of Engineering @ Petal)!</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tayloramurphy\"><strong>TAYLOR MURPHY</strong></a></h2><p>Taylor Murphy (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tayloramurphy\">@tayloramurphy</a>) is the Head of Product and Data of Meltano, an open-source data platform that enables collaboration, efficiency, and visibility. Taylor has been deeply involved in leading and building data-informed teams his entire career. At Concert Genetics he scaled the Data Operations team to enable the management of hundreds of thousands of genetic tests and millions of claims records. At GitLab, he was the first data hire where he focused on building and scaling the data organization as the company headed towards its IPO. Taylor has been involved with Meltano since its inception, acting as the primary customer with whom the team engaged to understand the needs of modern data professionals.</p><blockquote><p>\"What next? I put this in a dashboard. What are you gonna do with this? I think a lot of people are like, \u2018I wanna be more data-informed and I wanna build up a robust data organization.\u2019\u00a0</p><p>And that's where they stop. They think, \u2018Okay, I'm gonna get the data, and then I'm gonna make a decision.\u2019\u00a0</p><p>And that's not good enough because there's always gonna be more work to do than you can accomplish. And every time you deliver a dashboard, they're gonna go, \u2018Oh, this is great. What if we did this, this, and this?\u2019\u00a0</p><p>And that's fun for data people and you enjoy that, but you kind of wanna help them think through these things.\u201d</p><p>- Taylor Murphy \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Our in-person conference <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">ELC Annual</a> returns 10/27-28!</strong></h2><p>Learn from 60+ of the best engineering leaders in the industry / Critical insights on leadership, career and technology / Plus tons of experiences optimized for deep conversations & meaningful connections - all to help you build your support network!</p><p><strong><i>Don't miss out on being part of the biggest celebration of engineering leadership of the year!</i></strong></p><h3>Grab your ticket HERE: <strong><a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">sfelc.com/annual2022</a></strong></h3><hr /><h2>Check out our friends at <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\">Shortcut</a>!</h2><p><a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>Shortcut</strong></a> is an issue tracker that offers all the functionality, without most of the complexity making it easier for you to plan, collaborate, build, and measure success.</p><p><i><strong>Right now, listeners of our show can get 2-months free on any paid plan.</strong></i></p><h3><strong>Learn more & sign up at</strong> <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>shortcut.com/elc</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Taylor\u2019s early days at GitLab as its first data eng hire (2:23)</li><li>How Meltano evolved out of a GitLab business intelligence project (4:21)</li><li>Using data eng to discover problems & iterate solutions (6:01)</li><li>Why having data teams under finance can be detrimental to product strategy (7:22)</li><li>The importance of data eng representation at the VP level (10:01)</li><li>The ideal time to build your data eng team (12:57)</li><li>Communicating the ROI of data eng functions (14:53)</li><li>How to gain stakeholder buy-in (17:04)</li><li>Prioritizing qualitative data in a solution\u2019s early stages (18:54)</li><li>Taylor\u2019s recommendations for the early stages of building your data org (20:05)</li><li>Roadblocks when building data teams \u2013 and solutions for success (22:42)</li><li>The \u201crun your data team like a product team\u201d thesis (25:52)</li><li>Best practices for applying product team principles to your data eng functions (27:57)</li><li>The hand-off between data engineering & the broader engineering org (29:08)</li><li>Navigating company politics from a data eng perspective (33:02)</li><li>Prioritization conversations between data eng & other stakeholders (36:25)</li><li>Rapid-Fire Questions (38:31)</li></ul><h2>LINKS AND RESOURCES</h2><ul><li>(blog) \u201c<a href=\"https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/run-your-data-team-like-a-product-team/\">Run Your Data Team Like Product Team</a>\u201d by Emilie Schario & Taylor Murphy</li><li>(follow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josh_wills\">@josh_wills</a> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josh_wills\">https://twitter.com/josh_wills</a></li></ul>\n",
