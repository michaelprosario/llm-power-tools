    "Description": "<p>Adam Jacob, CEO of System Initiative, discusses a shift in infrastructure automation\u2014moving from writing code to building models that enable rapid simulations and collaboration. In The New Stack Makers, he compares this approach to Formula One racing, where teams use high-fidelity models to simulate race conditions, optimizing performance before hitting the track.</p><p>System Initiative applies this concept to enterprise automation, creating a model that understands how infrastructure components interact. This enables fast, multiplayer feedback loops, simplifying complex tasks while enhancing collaboration. Engineers can extend the system by writing small, reactive JavaScript functions that automate processes, such as transforming existing architectures into new ones. The platform visually represents these transformations, making automation more intuitive and efficient.</p><p>By leveraging models instead of traditional code-based infrastructure management, System Initiative enhances agility, reduces complexity, and improves DevOps collaboration. To explore how this ties into the concept of the digital twin, listen to the full<i>New Stack Makers </i>episode.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about System Initiative:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/system-initiative-goes-live-beyond-infrastructure-as-code/\">Beyond Infrastructure as Code: System Initiative Goes Live</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-system-initiative-treats-aws-components-as-digital-twins/\">How System Initiative Treats AWS Components as Digital Twins</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/system-initiative-code-now-open-source/\">System Initiative Code Now Open Source</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
