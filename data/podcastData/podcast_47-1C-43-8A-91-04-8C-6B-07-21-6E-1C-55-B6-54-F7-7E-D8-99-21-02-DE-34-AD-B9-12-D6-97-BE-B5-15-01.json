    "Description": "<p>How does healthcare function in the cloud? Richard talks to Lynn Langit about her work helping healthcare-related workloads move into the cloud. Lynn talks about how lift-and-shift is a great starting point - it stops analysis-paralysis and gets a baseline on costs in the cloud, which helps plan high return-on-investment activities around workloads. The conversation digs into the visualization challenge: It is hard to see what is being moved into the cloud and how it is operating there. Lynn digs into the cloud-as-architecture side of things since most customers do not know how working in the cloud is supposed to look, and there are distinct differences from on-premises operations!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://lynnlangit.com/\">Lynn's Website</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/programs/azure-fasttrack/#overview\">Azure FastTrack</a></li><li><a href=\"https://mran.microsoft.com/open\">Microsoft R Application Network</a></li></ul><p>Recorded May 2, 2022</p>\n",
