    "Description": "<p>Episode 800! Richard chats about making 800 episodes of RunAs with Microsoft Technical Fellow Jeffrey Snover. The conversation digs into the state of the IT business today, with the huge role of the cloud and digital transformation, and how it impacts the nature of work. Jeffrey talks about how the artificial intelligence in M365 is emerging as a tool to help people be more productive, by watching what they're working on and helping them to organize their information and efforts better. This leads to a discussion about privacy, understanding objectives and key results, and the ultimate goal of any system - better outcomes. Could this actually be the next generation of Microsoft technology? Hopefully it won't take another 800 shows to find out!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392\">The Strength of Weak Ties</a></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p>Recorded October 11, 2021</p>\n",
