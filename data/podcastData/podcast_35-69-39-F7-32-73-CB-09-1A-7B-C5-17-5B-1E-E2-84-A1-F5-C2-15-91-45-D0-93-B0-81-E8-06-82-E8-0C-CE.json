    "Description": "<p>What role does PowerShell play in DevOps? Richard talks to Rick Taylor about his experiences building deployment pipelines for development and operations using a variety of tools, including PowerShell. Rick talks about how each tool, including PowerShell, can be the easiest solution to a given task. The conversation also turns to cross-platform deployments, where the implementations of tooling vary from platform-to-platform. PowerShell can help there too, but you do have to learn the platform you're working from! In the end, even PowerShell is just a tool, and DevOps is more about culture and process - and the conversation goes there too!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/\">Terraform</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\">Ansible</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7\">PowerShell for macOS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7\">PowerShell for Linux</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/\">Azure DevOps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/pester/Pester\">Pester</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.servicenow.ind.in/\">ServiceNow</a></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
