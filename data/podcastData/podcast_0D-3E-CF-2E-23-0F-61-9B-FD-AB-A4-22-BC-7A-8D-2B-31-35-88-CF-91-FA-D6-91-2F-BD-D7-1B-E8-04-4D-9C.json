    "Description": "<p>We can tackle sustainability issues by empowering students. I would also think that this could apply to helping students be part of the solution for health in their communities and schools. Let's face it, if we're going to solve hard problems, we need lots of minds, hands, and feet involved in moving towards the solution. I recorded this some time ago, but you'll get some ideas (like I did) for what we can do now.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e668\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e668</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Sponsor: My friend Kasey Bell writes the Shake Up Learning Blog.
