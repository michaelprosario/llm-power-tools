    "Description": "<p>Vic Putz continues to carry a torch for the SpaceOrb, as do I, except he's actually doing something about it. Vic has been working on a new version called the Orbotron 9001 for the last few years that is an interface for the SpaceOrb to modern systems. Scott talks to Vic about their shared love of this 25 year old controller and why the world is missing out on the magic of 6 degrees of freedom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>http://www.thingotron.com</li>\n<li>https://www.x360ce.com</li>\n<li>https://playoverload.com</li>\n<li>https://www.dxx-rebirth.com</li>\n</ul>\n",
