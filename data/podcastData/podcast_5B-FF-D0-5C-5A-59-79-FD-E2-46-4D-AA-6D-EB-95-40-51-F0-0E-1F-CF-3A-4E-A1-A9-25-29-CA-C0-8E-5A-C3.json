The team was frustrated with meeting overload and took bold steps to evaluate and modify their meeting structure. They questioned the value of Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives, ultimately creating a more focused approach to meetings. A significant breakthrough came when they removed managers from the Daily Scrum, leading to more effective communication and increased quality time for actual work. The team's success came from creating a backlog of improvements and integrating these directly into their sprint work.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question: How might your team benefit from critically evaluating your current meeting structure and making bold changes?</p>   Featured Book of the Week: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3EHnGWZ\"> The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni</a>  was a game-changer for Anuj, offering a model for understanding team dynamics.
