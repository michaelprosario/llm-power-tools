    "Description": "<p>Once they have piloted Kubernetes, many organizations then want to scale up their K8s deployments, and run workloads across many clusters. But managing multiple clusters requires a new set of tools, ones that automate many routine and manual tasks. So, for its <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/11/18/cncf-end-user-technology-radar-database-storage-november-2020/\">fifth Tech Radar report</a>, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation surveyed the tools available for multicluster management, based on the input from its end-user community.</p><p>In this edition of <a href=\"/podcasts/analysts\">The New Stack Analysts</a> podcast, we talk with two people who helped assemble the report, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/recollir\">Federico Hernandez</a>, principal engineer social media analysis provider <a href=\"https://www.meltwater.com/fr\">Meltwater</a>, and <a href=\"https://se.linkedin.com/in/dezmodue\">Simone Sciarrati</a>, Meltwater engineering team lead. We chatted about the report's findings and how the multicluster management tool landscape is taking shape. Co-hosting this episode is <a href=\"/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a>, founder and publisher of The New Stack and the Tech Radar's organizer <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/cheryljhung\">Cheryl Hung</a>, CNCF vice president of ecosystem.</p>\n",
