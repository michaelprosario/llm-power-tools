Or if you want to know why so many schools are getting eSports programs, this episode is a must-listen for you. Welcome to another episode of the 10 Minute Teacher Podcast, where today we're diving into the game-changing world of scholastic esports.</p> <p>Our guest, Danielle Johnson, Executive Director of the Texas Scholastic Esports Federation, shares how esports is not just about gaming but about boosting student engagement, improving academic performance, and building a more inclusive school community.</p> <p>Esports are rapidly growing in schools across the country. The reasons are not only that they are fun but they are making a positive impact on a generation of students whose favorite sport is video games. If you're skeptical, we'll speak to your concerns as well.\u00a0</p> <p>Tune in to discover why esports might just be the missing piece in your educational toolkit and how you can start a program at your school.</p> <p>Show Sponsor: Edge U Badges -\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.forward-edge.net/edgeubadges/\">Edge U Badges</a>\u00a0from Forward Edge is a fantastic micro credentialing program for teachers, administrators, and school staff.
