She emphasizes the importance of collecting data and measuring key indicators like self-management, which she tests by occasionally stepping back from daily Scrum meetings to observe team autonomy. Season also stresses the value of one-on-one conversations to understand individual goals and assess team event effectiveness.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How do you measure the effectiveness of your role as a Scrum Master beyond just following ceremonies?</p>   Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Lean Coffee <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Season recommends the <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/tag/lean-coffee-retrospective/\">  Lean Coffee format for retrospectives</a>  as it puts control directly in the hands of participants who decide the discussion topics. This approach naturally increases engagement and ownership of the retrospective process. She emphasizes the importance of including warm-up activities to set the right mood and ensuring everyone speaks early in the session, while also following up on previous retrospective actions.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
