    "Description": "<p>What if the most powerful technology in human history is being built by people who openly admit they don&#39;t trust each other? In this explosive 2-hour debate, three AI experts pull back the curtain on the shocking psychology driving the race to Artificial General Intelligence\u2014and why the people building it might be the biggest threat of all. Kokotajlo predicts AGI by 2028 based on compute scaling trends. Marcus argues we haven&#39;t solved basic cognitive problems from his 2001 research. The stakes? If Kokotajlo is right and Marcus is wrong about safety progress, humanity may have already lost control.</p><p><br></p><p>Sponsor messages:</p><p>========</p><p>Google Gemini: Google Gemini features Veo3, a state-of-the-art AI video generation model in the Gemini app. Sign up at https://gemini.google.com</p><p><br></p><p>Tufa AI Labs are hiring for ML Engineers and a Chief Scientist in Zurich/SF.
