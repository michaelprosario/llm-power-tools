    "Description": "<p>Does Python round numbers the same way you learned back in math class? You might be surprised by the default method Python uses and the variety of ways to round numbers in Python. Christopher Trudeau is back on the show this week, bringing another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>Christopher discusses his recent video course, &ldquo;Rounding Numbers in Python.&rdquo; He covers rounding bias and how to avoid introducing it into your dataset. We dig into the various rounding strategies and how to implement them in Python.</p>\n<p>We also share several other articles and projects from the Python community, including a news roundup, a fast Python linter for error-free and maintainable code, the decline of the user interface, more thoughts on Python in Excel, a discussion about calendar versioning for Python, a financial database as a Python module, and a project to prettify the colors of your terminal user interfaces.</p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Sentry.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/rounding-numbers-python/\">Rounding Numbers in Python</a></p>\n<p>In this video course, you&rsquo;ll learn about the mistakes you might make when rounding numbers and how to best manage or avoid them. It&rsquo;s a great place to start for the early to intermediate Python developer who&rsquo;s interested in using Python for finance, data science, or scientific computing.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:02:06 &ndash; NumPy 2.0.0 Release Notes</li>\n<li>00:02:52 &ndash; Python 3.13.0 beta 3 released</li>\n<li>00:03:05 &ndash; Announcing the PSF Board Candidates for 2024!</li>\n<li>00:03:27 &ndash; Prohibiting Outlook Email Domains</li>\n<li>00:04:31 &ndash; Ruff: A Python Linter for Error-Free and Maintainable Code</li>\n<li>00:09:31 &ndash; Sponsor: Sentry</li>\n<li>00:10:35 &ndash; The Decline of the User Interface</li>\n<li>00:19:14 &ndash; My Thoughts on Python in Excel</li>\n<li>00:26:30 &ndash; Rounding Numbers in Python</li>\n<li>00:30:53 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:32:13 &ndash; PEP 2026: Calendar Versioning for Python</li>\n<li>00:42:37 &ndash; Financial Database as a Python Module</li>\n<li>00:45:34 &ndash; prettypretty: Build Awesome Terminal User Interfaces</li>\n<li>00:47:48 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>News:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/2.0.0-notes.html\">NumPy 2.0.0 Release Notes \u2014 NumPy v2.0 Manual</a> &ndash; The long awaited 2.0 release of NumPy landed this week.
