    "Description": "<p>How well do you know Python&rsquo;s math module? Maybe you&rsquo;ve used a few of the constants or arithmetic functions. You may be surprised by the amount of functionality hiding within this built-in library, and perhaps you don&rsquo;t need to reach for an additional outside library. This week on the show, David Amos is back, and he&rsquo;s brought another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\n<p>We discuss a recent video course about the math module. David shares a recent article about implementing efficient queues and stacks with Python&rsquo;s deque (double-ended queue) class. We also talk about an article that shares 25 Pandas functions you may not have known to exist.</p>\n<p>We cover several other articles and projects from the Python community including, visualization and interactive dashboards  in Python with HoloViz, designing a camera with Python and PyRayT, graphing data science with Python and networkx, another useful Python pdf library, and runtime software verification and automated testing for scientific software in Python with a project named paranoidscientist.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/exploring-python-math-module/\">Exploring the Python math Module</a></p>\n<p>In this step-by-step course, you&rsquo;ll learn all about Python&rsquo;s math module for higher-level mathematical functions. Whether you&rsquo;re working on a scientific project, a financial application, or any other type of programming endeavor, you just can&rsquo;t escape the need for math!</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:02:09 &ndash; Python&rsquo;s deque: Implement Efficient Queues and Stacks</li>\n<li>00:07:31 &ndash; Visualization and Interactive Dashboard in Python</li>\n<li>00:14:11 &ndash; Sponsor: DataStax Astra DB</li>\n<li>00:14:42 &ndash; Design a Camera with Python and PyRayT</li>\n<li>00:19:39 &ndash; 25 Pandas Functions You Didn&rsquo;t Know Existed</li>\n<li>00:27:03 &ndash; Graph Data Science With Python and NetworkX</li>\n<li>00:33:01 &ndash; Exploring the Python math Module</li>\n<li>00:40:51 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:42:12 &ndash; paranoidscientist: Runtime Software Verification and Automated Testing for Scientific Software in Python</li>\n<li>00:45:33 &ndash; borb: A Python PDF library</li>\n<li>00:49:01 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-deque/\">Python&rsquo;s deque: Implement Efficient Queues and Stacks</a> &ndash; In this step-by-step tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn about Python&rsquo;s <code>deque</code> and how to use it to perform efficient pop and append operations on both ends of your sequences. Deques are commonly used to build queues and stacks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/visualization-and-interactive-dashboard-in-python-c2f2a88b2ba3\">Visualization and Interactive Dashboard in Python</a> &ndash; Have you ever heard of HoloViz? It&rsquo;s a set of Python visualization and plotting tools for browser-based data visualization and presentation. In this article, Sophia Yang \u2014 a senior data scientist at Anaconda \u2014 explains why she loves HoloViz and what her workflow looks like when using it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fotonixx.com/posts/design-a-camera-with-python-and-pyrayt/\">Design a Camera with Python and PyRayT</a> &ndash; Camera lenses are more complex than you might think. If you cut open a camera to look at a cross-section, you&rsquo;d see that a lens is actually made up of several smaller lenses. This article explores how camera lenses work using a new Python raytracing project called <a href=\"https://github.com/rfrazier716/PyRayT\">PyRayT</a> that&rsquo;s designed for designing optical systems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/25-pandas-functions-you-didnt-know-existed-p-guarantee-0-8-1a05dcaad5d0\">25 Pandas Functions You Didn&rsquo;t Know Existed</a> &ndash; Did you know that you can style the pandas DataFrame output in a notebook? This listicle covers twenty-five pandas functions that you may not have heard of, including <code>.explode()</code>, <code>.squeeze()</code>, and the pandas DataFrame styler. There&rsquo;s something in this article for everyone, so read it to find out how you can take your pandas skills to the next level.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/data-science/graph-data-science-python-networkx\">Graph Data Science With Python and NetworkX</a> &ndash; Graph theory network analysis can yield deep data insights that are difficult to tease out via alternative methods. Get a taste of what graph analysis can do in this quick, hands-on tutorial that uses <a href=\"https://github.com/networkx\">NetworkX</a> to create and analyze a graph.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/exploring-python-math-module/\">Exploring the Python math Module</a> &ndash; In this step-by-step course, you&rsquo;ll learn all about Python&rsquo;s <code>math</code> module for higher-level mathematical functions.
