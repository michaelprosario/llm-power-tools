    "Description": "<p>Have you ever had a moment when your life changed? Perhaps it was a comment or it was a moment and although it may not have seemed to be anything to others around you, you experienced a seismic shift in how you viewed yourself. Dr. Michael Rousell studies these moments and relates them to neuroscience. Today he shares the surprising science behind the commonalities in these life-changing moments. As teachers, we hope to be part of these moments.</p> <p>You could say these small but very epic life-changing moments are the seconds that could take years of relationship building and effort to cultivate and then, light a bolt of lightning - it happens - and a child is transformed for the good. You'll want to learn to understand these moments as a teacher. This is one of those episodes to share and discuss due to the exciting impacts it can have in the life of children.</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e581\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e581</a>\u00a0</p> Sponsor: The U.S. Toyota Dream Car Art Contest invites youth, ages 4-15, to submit their original hand-drawn artworks that answer the question, \u201cIf you could design a car to make the world a better place, what would it look like?\u201d Artwork submissions for this free youth art contest are accepted this year from November 1, 2019, through January 31, 2020.
