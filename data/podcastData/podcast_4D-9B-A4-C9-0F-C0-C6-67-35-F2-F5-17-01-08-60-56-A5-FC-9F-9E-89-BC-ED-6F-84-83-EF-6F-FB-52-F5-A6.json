    "Description": "<p>\u00a0Luis Garcia - The Journey Story of a Learning Technologist</p>\n<p>Kicking off this episode with Luis Garcia by sharing a memorable quote by Jim Barksdale. \"If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine.\u201d How true is that? Our lives are now measured consistently by data. How many clicks, impressions, shares, comments, open rate, and more. What does the data reveal about human behavior? People also have opinions and those matter because they reflect so much insight. Different ways of thinking, knowledge, experience, wisdom, problems and solutions.</p>\n<p>Luis kicked off the show by sharing that his love of learning started at an early age. He began learning how to program when he was 7 years old. His parents wanted him to focus on that as a career path.</p>\n<p>As he got older he discovered his real passion for music - FYI, he plays the guitar and keyboard. He and his twin brother came to the US with his parents visiting colleges with a focus on computer programming. The family visited top tier Ivey League schools and decided to visit Orlando on the way back. That is when Luis and his brother toured Full Sail.</p>\n<p>Now another twist in the career roller coaster happened. FS launched a new degree in digital media. This was a combination of music, graphics with a dash of virtual reality technology.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To hear more about Luis career story, thoughts about 2030 and AI, listen to the WHOLE show. This one is an exciting story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>#iHeartRadio #ApplePodcasts #GooglePlay #Spotify #Stitcher #Podbean #YouTube #Employers4Change #E4C #internships #radio #podcast #innovation #employers #smallbusiness #business #FutureOfWork #ValenciaCollegeRadio</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
