    "Description": "<p>We\u2019re featuring another popular session from ELC Annual 2023 \u2013 welcome to \u201cHealthy Tension: GTM & Product/Eng Collaboration at Hundreds of Millions ARR Scale\u201d with Tido Carriero, (Co-Founder @ Koala and Former VPE @ Segment) and Joe Morrissey (General Partner @ a16z & Former CRO @ Segment)! Tido & Joe share stories from the beginning of their partnership at Segment, including their first cross-functional annual planning meeting. They highlight lessons learned from those early days and how others can implement annual planning session frameworks to develop value drivers for their org in order to better serve customers & create products with value. Joe & Tido also cover how to build a healthy, trusting relationship between product & eng when it comes to building / executing a successful GTM strategy.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT TIDO CARREIRO</strong></h2><p>Tido is the Co-Founder & CEO of Koala. Prior to Koala, he led the Product & Engineering team at Segment from less than $5M in ARR to their $3.2B acquisition by Twilio.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI had been at Segment for four years. The big unlock for me and I think what I needed to lean into more in retrospect from a trust perspective was that Joe was really going to be a different kind of go to market partner. We had zoomed way out. We had looked at a multi-year strategy, not just a list of 25 features and ordering them quarter by quarter by quarter.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Tido Carriero \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT JOE MORRISSEY</strong></h2><p>Joe Morrissey is a general partner on the Growth investing team at Andreessen Horowitz, focused on enterprise technology companies.

Before Segment, he was was the EMEA vice president and general manager for three open source software companies: Hortonworks, which combined with Cloudera in a $5.2B merger in 2019; MongoDB, which went public in 2017; and MySQL, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems for $1B in 2008. Joe holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in business studies from the University of Limerick, Ireland. He currently serves on the boards of Neon Inc., and Hopsworks AB and lives in Menlo Park with his wife and two kids.</p><blockquote><p>\"You've got to go through this tension and I think one of the things that can happen is you avoid the tension, you avoid the conflict, you say yes to things that maybe you're not comfortable with both on the product and on the go to market side then the plan goes wrong, right? So I really think like the tension is the critical thing and that the struggle is the critical thing and that's where the learning is.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Joe Morrissey \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>We now have 10 local communities of engineering leaders hosting in-person meetups all over the world!</h2><p>Local communities are led by eng leaders just like you, who wanted to create a place to connect, share insights & tackle critical challenges in the job.</p><p><strong>New York City, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, London, Amsterdam,</strong> and <strong>Toronto</strong> in-person events are happening now!</p><h3>We\u2019re launching local events all the time - get involved at elc.community!</h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Joe\u2019s first impressions of Tido & the beginning of their relationship (2:28)</li><li>The story of their low point & working together on annual planning (5:32)</li><li>What was agreed on in the annual planning session (7:44)</li><li>Focusing on value drivers & building a trusting GTM partnership (10:55)</li><li>Why it\u2019s necessary to embrace tension in order to drive growth (15:01)</li><li>Tido\u2019s lessons learned leading eng product & sales @ Koala (16:05)</li><li>Audience Q&A: Frameworks for narrowing down value drivers (19:00)</li><li>The importance of cross-functional participation in planning sessions (22:21)</li><li>An inside look at the exercise of identifying value drivers (24:02)</li><li>How deep should salespeople go on the product?
