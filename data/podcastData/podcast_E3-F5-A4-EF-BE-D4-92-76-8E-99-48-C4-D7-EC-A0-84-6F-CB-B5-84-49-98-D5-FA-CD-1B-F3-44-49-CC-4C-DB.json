    "Description": "<p>The definition of \u201clow-code, no-code\u201d remains a subject of debate. For some, it is the ability for a so-called \u201ccitizen developer\u201d who lacks the training and skills to develop software \u2014 to be able to rely on a platform to deploy code with the same level of competence as that of a professional software engineer. Others describe low-code, no-code as a way to rely on a platform that facilitates software development \u2014 while automating many of the tasks in a build \u2014 to both simplify the process for inexperienced developers and to save time and resources for experienced developers. In both cases in this increasingly crowded space, low-code, no-code makes the coding and software development process simpler and more automated as a result.</p><p>In the case of low-code, no-code platform provider <a href=\"https://gopaddle.io/\">gopaddle</a>, the idea is to to \u201cunleash the power of a no-code platform for modern applications.\u201d How low-code, no-code can be applied to Go-centric applications running in cloud native environments was the main subject of this The New Stack Makers podcast with <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/vinothini-raju-9817ab5\">Vinothini Raju</a>, founder and CEO, gopaddle as the guest.
