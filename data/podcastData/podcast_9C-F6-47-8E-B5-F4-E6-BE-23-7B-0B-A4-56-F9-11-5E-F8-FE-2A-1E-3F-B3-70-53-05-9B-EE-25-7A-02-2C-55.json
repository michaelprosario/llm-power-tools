He shares that effective scrum masters unlock team productivity by focusing on people first, ensuring everyone is aligned and engaged in their work.</p>   Featured Book of the Week: Drive by Dan Pink <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Kevin shares that his greatest influence isn't a book, but the Agile podcasts such as this one and others. As a new scrum master, it was the insights from experienced professionals that shaped his journey. However, he recommends <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3xGXZTd\"> \"Drive\" by Dan Pink</a>, which emphasizes intrinsic motivation through mastery, purpose, and autonomy.
