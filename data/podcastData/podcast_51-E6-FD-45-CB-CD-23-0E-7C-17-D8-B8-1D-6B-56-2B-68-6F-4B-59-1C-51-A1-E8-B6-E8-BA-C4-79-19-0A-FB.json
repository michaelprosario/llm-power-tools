    "Description": "<p>Conflict is a necessary part of the job. So how can you transform conflict to be collaborative, not competitive? Jordan Adler (Head of Dev Eng @ OneSignal) previews his conflict optimization workshop taking place at our 2022 Spring Virtual Summit! Jordan shares some of the main sources of conflict in eng teams, how to uncover underlying needs, shift people from entrenched positions & other frameworks to create an optimal environment for healthy conflict.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/jordanmadler\"><strong>JORDAN ADLER</strong></a></h2><p>Jordan M. Adler (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordanmadler\">@jordanmadler</a>) is the Head of Developer Engineering at OneSignal, where he drives the cutting edge of cross-platform customer engagement messaging APIs & SDKs. Previously, Jordan evolved Engineering Productivity at Cruise, led API Platform engineering at Pinterest, and was a Strategic Partner Engineer and Developer Advocate at Google, where he managed technical partnerships between major organizations and Google.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLooking at the conflict in particular, how do we switch from 'positions' to 'interests?'</p><p>Right. So how do we take away from... \u2018Hey, this is what I want, this is what you want.\u2019</p><p>To... \u2018This is the reason that I have a particular want. And this is the reason that you have a particular want. And if we have clarity together, collectively on what those interests are, then we can collaboratively work towards a solution.\u2019\"</p><p>- Jordan Adler \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>\u00a0</h3><h3>The <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3NjjUTv\">ELC Virtual Summit</a> is BACK on April 20th-22nd!</h3><p>We\u2019re bringing together engineering leaders from around the world to surface fresh industry insights & help you build peer support.
