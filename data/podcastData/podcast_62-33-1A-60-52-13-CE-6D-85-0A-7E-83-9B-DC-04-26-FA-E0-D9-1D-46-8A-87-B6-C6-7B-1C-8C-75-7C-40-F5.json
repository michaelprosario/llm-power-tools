Sara Owen - Bio as Submitted <p>Sara is a field ecologist at the Montana Natural Heritage Program, where she leads the Wetland and Riparian Mapping Center's mapping program for the western U.S. She loves fieldwork because it allows her to explore new places while working with and learning from other ecology nerds like herself. Sara is the author of \"<a href= \"https://www.sweetgrassbooks.com/the-books-new-releases/2020/6/19/seth-and-matties-big-river-adventure\">Seth and Mattie's Big River Adventure</a>,\" an educational adventure storybook that introduces young, budding ecologists (ages 7-10) to the world of stream ecology. Although she doesn't get to do it often enough, Sara loves to take kids of all ages (including those 80-year-old kids!) on Stream Walks where they flip over rocks to see who's living beneath them. She's always up to some adventure or another, which you can follow on Instagram: @thenomadicecologist</p> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
