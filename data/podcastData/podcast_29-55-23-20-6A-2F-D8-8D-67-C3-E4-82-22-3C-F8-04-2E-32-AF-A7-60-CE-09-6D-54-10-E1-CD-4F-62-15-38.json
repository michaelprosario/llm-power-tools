    "Description": "  Xmas Special: From Project-Driven to Flow-Driven Software Development in 2025 with Vasco Duarte <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  In the kickoff episode of the \u201c5 Wishes for 2025\u201d series, Vasco Duarte dives into a topic close to his heart: why managing software like construction projects leads to failure. Drawing on his experience in the Agile community and sharing compelling real-world examples, Vasco introduces a new perspective on how software development should flow, adapt, and continuously deliver value.</p>   Software Development: Stop Building Houses, Start Growing Gardens <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cSoftware is more like a garden than a construction site\u2014continuous care and attention are key to thriving.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco begins by debunking the myth that software development can be meticulously planned like a construction project. Sharing a story about a failed 18-month software endeavor, he highlights how rigid plans crumble in the face of changing markets. Instead, he advocates for an adaptive, flow-based approach to software development, comparing it to the continuous nurturing required in a garden.</p>   Why Projects Fall Short in Software Development <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cYou can\u2019t plan your year\u2019s meals in January\u2014why would you try that with software?\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco identifies three critical flaws of project-driven software development:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 16pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  1.  Assumption of Stability: Markets and requirements shift too fast for static plans.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 16pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  2.  Front-loaded Decisions: Early decisions often fail to hold up over time.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-left: 16pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  3.  Artificial Boundaries: Restrictive scopes kill innovation and flexibility.</p>   The Three-Step Framework for Flow-Based Software Development   1. Continuous Delivery <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cSoftware is like a shark\u2014it has to keep moving or it dies.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco explains how companies can succeed by continuously delivering updates to users. He shares insights from a mobile startup using experiments and feedback loops to keep evolving and delivering measurable value.</p>   2. Incremental Funding <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cFund software like a business, not like a construction project.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Drawing on ideas from Lean-Agile financial planning, Vasco introduces incremental funding as a smarter way to manage development. He points listeners to a previous episode with experts <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2019/04/podcast/bonus-lean-and-agile-financial-planning-with-maarit-laanti-and-rami-sirkia/\">  Maarit Laanti and Rami Sirkia for deeper insights</a>.</p>   3. Goal-Oriented Teams <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cTeams need goals, not just backlogs.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Vasco stresses the importance of giving teams end-to-end ownership of the value they create. The backlog is a tool, but the real focus should be on clear goals that align with business impact. He mentions his <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://vascoduarte.substack.com/p/the-key-to-successful-engineering\">  OTOG - One-Team-One-Goal blog post</a>.\u00a0</p>   Raising Agility to the Portfolio Level <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cFlow-based software development lets us make quick, strategic decisions at the portfolio level.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  By embracing continuous delivery, incremental funding, and goal-driven teams, organizations can elevate agility from individual teams to the entire portfolio. Vasco highlights this as a game-changer for modern businesses, enabling quicker, smarter product decisions.</p>   Global Agile Summit 2025 \u2013 Don\u2019t Miss Out! <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  \u201cJoin us in Tallinn to see flow-based software delivery in action.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://globalagilesummit.com/gas-25-super-early-bird-announcement/?utm_source=e5021_smtp&utm_medium=e5021_smtp&utm_campaign=e5021_smtp\">  Vasco invites listeners to the Global Agile Summit 2025</a>, where real-world examples of flow-based development will take center stage.
