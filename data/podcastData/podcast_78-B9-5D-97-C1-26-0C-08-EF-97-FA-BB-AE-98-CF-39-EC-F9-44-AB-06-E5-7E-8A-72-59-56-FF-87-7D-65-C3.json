    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p>Today's episode was inspired <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/416309/do-developers-fear-merge-conflicts\">by a question </a>on folks who postpone a merge for fear of being the one to resolve a conflict. Shout out to Candied Orange for the thoughtful answer.</p><p>Paul and Sara reminisce about the days before Git, when version control was very different from what it is today, and Paul accidentally left many a project in shambles. Do you remember the days of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1261/what-are-the-advantages-of-using-svn-over-cvs\">Subversion and CVS</a>?\u00a0<br /><br />Later, we dig into Sara's new adventure with <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter Notebooks</a>. They are extremely useful for developers, but what would it take to make them a tool for any kind of knowledge worker? Default to a PowerPoint style, obviously.<br /><br />Last but not least, we dig into the endless argument over the 10X developer, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/08/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-on-high-salaries-the-best-are-easily-10x-better-than-average.html\">Reed Hastings' love</a> for the 100X developer, and the true formula for attracting employees that will contribute their genius without wrecking the team. \u00a0Clive Thompson has <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90320578/10x-rock-stars-and-the-myth-of-meritocracy\">a great piece</a> on the myth, meritocracy, and messy reality of rockstar coders.</p>\n",
