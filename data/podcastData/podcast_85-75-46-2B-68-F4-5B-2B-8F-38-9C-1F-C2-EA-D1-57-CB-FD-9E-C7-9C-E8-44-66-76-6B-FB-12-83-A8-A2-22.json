    "Description": "When Matt Mitchell saw the news anchor mention his home country of Grenada, he sat up straight. But his excitement soon turned to confusion when this trusted tv newscaster mispronounced names and places in Grenada, and declared facts that conflicted with reports from his relatives back home. It made him think hard about where data comes from, who tells it, and how it can shift as it exchanges hands. That was the beginning of his passion for news and his work in data journalism. He tells us about his journey, what it\u2019s like to work at the NY Times, and how he combines his love of code to his passion for the news. Show Links Partner with Dev &amp; CodeNewbie!
