The second was, what is the biggest problem that we are coming in to solve? Like why were each of us hired? It came down to, and this was difficult for a couple of the department heads was, 'Look, the biggest problem isn't in your area. I'm sorry. Yes. Let's put together a plan of how do we improve and what do we focus on in your group? But quite frankly, the focus is going to be in this area.'
