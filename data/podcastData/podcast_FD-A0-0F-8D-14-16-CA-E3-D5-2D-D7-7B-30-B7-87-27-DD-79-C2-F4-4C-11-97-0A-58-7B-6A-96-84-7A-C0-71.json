Right? You know, very, very tough to hear... But was very, very valuable! I mean, it really honed our message and it was precisely the thing we needed to hear, to actually make our pitch a lot better...\u201d</p><p>Brian: I actually, I didn't find it that tough to hear. I always presumptively assume that whatever I'm doing is awful so to hear some of the reflected back, I'm like, 'Yes! It is terrible! Tell us more. Give us the worst.'</p><p>I really, I love that actually.\u201d</p><p>Aaron: \u201cHence why I'm always the optimistic one and Brian always dragged me back to reality.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cHe was so wounded by it! I'm like, 'Yeah, it's a terrible deck!'\u201d</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT ORGSPACE</strong></h2><p>Orgspace is a management ops platform for software teams that helps your leaders scale.
