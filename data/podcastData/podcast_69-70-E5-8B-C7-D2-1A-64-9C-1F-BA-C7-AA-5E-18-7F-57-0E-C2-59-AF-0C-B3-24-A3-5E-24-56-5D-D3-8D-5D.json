    "Description": "<p>Today\u2019s guest on <a href='https://internwhisperer.podbean.com'>The Intern Whisperer</a> is Juan Rivera, game developer, #innovator, and #visionary that works at the <a href='https://ocls.info/melrose'>Melrose Center</a> at the <a href='https://ops.info'>Orlando Public Library</a>. I originally met Juan when participating at <a href='https://omglabs.pro'>OMG Labs</a> and <a href='http://www.indienomicon.org'>Indienomicon</a> #GameJams. I am so happy to have this opportunity to get to know him on a more candid level. Three big takeaways I want to share with our listening audience were:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">He had an idea to create a tablet device like the iPad before it was invented to share comics.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">When asked about the ethical dilemmas about the future he shared he believes it would be the ability to interact with other humans would be traded for the convenience to work\u00a0 remotely, live a digital lifestyle, and isolate people more from one another.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Best mentoring advice Juan shared with our listeners. Just Do It.\u00a0 </li>\n</ol>",
