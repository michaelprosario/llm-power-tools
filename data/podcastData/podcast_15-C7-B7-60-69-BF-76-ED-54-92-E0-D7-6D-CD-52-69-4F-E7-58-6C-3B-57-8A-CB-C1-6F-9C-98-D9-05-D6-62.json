    "Description": "<p>Scott talks to Anthony van der Hoorn and Nik Molnar from the open source Glimpse Project. You may remember them from show 273. A lot has happened since then and now Red Gate is supporting the Glimpse Guys full time. Is this a good thing or the end of Glimpse? What's changed at Red Gate since the Reflector acquisition and what does it mean for Glimpse going forward. All this and more.</p>\n",
