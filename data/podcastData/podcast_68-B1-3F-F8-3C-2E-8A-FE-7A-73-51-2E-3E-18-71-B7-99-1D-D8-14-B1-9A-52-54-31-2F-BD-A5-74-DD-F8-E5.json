This experience eventually led her to a job at Google, where she worked in product development.</p><p>While at Google, Leven realized the challenge of deciphering legacy code and onboarding developers to it. Inspired by a presentation by Bret Victor, she came up with the idea for CodeSee\u2014a developer platform that helps teams understand and review code bases more effectively.

She also shared advice on raising money from venture capitalists and building a company culture.</p><p>Listen to the full episode and check out more installments from The Tech Founder Odyssey.</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-teleports-leader-transitioned-from-engineer-to-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">How Teleport\u2019s Leader Transitioned from Engineer to CEO</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-2-founders-sold-their-startup-to-aqua-security-in-a-year/\" target=\"_blank\">How 2 Founders Sold Their Startup to Aqua Security in a Year</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-solvos-co-founder-got-the-guts-to-be-an-entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\">How Solvo\u2019s Co-Founder Got the \u2018Guts\u2019 to Be an Entrepreneur</a></p>\n",
