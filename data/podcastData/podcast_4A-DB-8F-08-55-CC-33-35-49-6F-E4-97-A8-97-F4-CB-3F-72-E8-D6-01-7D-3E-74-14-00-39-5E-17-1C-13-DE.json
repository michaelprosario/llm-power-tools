Ben still hasn't mastered a single language, so it's a tough for him to know if it's better to start with the difficult fundamentals or stay in the simplified sandbox.</p><p>Flatiron tries to teach developers how to code, but also how to communicate. Every student has to do some public writing or speaking about their education. We check out<i> </i><a href=\"https://humanreadablemag.com/issues/1\"><i>Human Readable Magazine</i></a> and the painfully honest <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/et4l59/human_readable_magazine_issue_1_is_out_check_it/\">Reddit thread</a> of early reviews.</p><p>Rebekah tries to coach Ben through a mock interview for a junior web developer position. A torrent of word salad ensues. Paul and Sara show no mercy.</p><p>New York City parking meters aren't the only systems being taken down by calendar bugs. We chat about the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jxxf/status/1219009308438024200\">delightful Twitter thread on Y2038</a>.</p><p>You can follow Rebekah <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RRombom\">here </a>and learn more about The Flatiron School <a href=\"https://flatironschool.com/\">here</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
