    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with the top contributor on Stack Overflow, Jon Skeet. You will learn what is versioning, how that affects developers and how that affects data scientists. You will hear about compiled versus interpreted languages, what is the silver bullet in cold diagnostics, what kind of problems you want to diagnose and the 'divide and conquer' principle. You will also hear about the importance of community, what it means to be part of a community and how communities grow, what you can do as a data scientist to make our community be more inclusive, more welcoming and prosper further.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/285\">www.superdatascience.com/285</a></p>\n      ",
