    "Description": "<p>Today I share a post I wrote several years a go that tends to be shared like crazy this time of year. I hope it encourages you to finish well. Here's the link to the blog post: <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/how-to-make-it-to-the-end-of-the-school-year/\"> http://www.coolcatteacher.com/how-to-make-it-to-the-end-of-the-school-year/</a></p> <p>I've also got a new way I'm posting transcripts. Once the show goes up, give it a few hours and the transcript will go live at <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e66\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e66</a></p> <p>So, it is the episode number and the letter e in front for all episodes. I hope you find this encouraging and happy Teacher Appreciation Week!</p>",
