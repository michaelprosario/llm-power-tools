    "Description": "<p>Professor Michael Levin explores the revolutionary concept of diverse intelligence, demonstrating how cognitive capabilities extend far beyond traditional brain-based intelligence. Drawing from his groundbreaking research, he explains how even simple biological systems like gene regulatory networks exhibit learning, memory, and problem-solving abilities. Levin introduces key concepts like \"cognitive light cones\" - the scope of goals a system can pursue - and shows how these ideas are transforming our approach to cancer treatment and biological engineering. His insights challenge conventional views of intelligence and agency, with profound implications for both medicine and artificial intelligence development. This deep discussion reveals how understanding intelligence as a spectrum, from molecular networks to human minds, could be crucial for humanity's future technological development. Contains technical discussion of biological systems, cybernetics, and theoretical frameworks for understanding emergent cognition.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Prof. Michael Levin</p>\n<p>https://as.tufts.edu/biology/people/faculty/michael-levin</p>\n<p>https://x.com/drmichaellevin</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Sponsor message:</p>\n<p>DO YOU WANT WORK ON ARC with the MindsAI team (current ARC winners)?</p>\n<p>Interested?
