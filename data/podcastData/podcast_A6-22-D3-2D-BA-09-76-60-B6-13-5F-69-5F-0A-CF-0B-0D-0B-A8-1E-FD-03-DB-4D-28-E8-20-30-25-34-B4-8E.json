    "SourceUrl": "https://runasradio.com/Shows/Show/866",
    "Description": "<p>How about a free suite of over 500 tools for SQL Server best practices, administration, development, and migration? Richard talks to Rob Sewell about the ever-growing dbatools PowerShell module. While its origins are in migrating SQL Server databases from one environment (and version) to another, the range of capabilities is extensive. Rob talks about the power of repeatability when attempting to do these potentially complex tasks - which is best served by scripting. But why write the scripts when they already exist? The conversation also digs into learning as a DBA, including getting involved with conferences like SQLBits!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://dbatools.io/\">dbatools</a></li><li><a href=\"https://dbachecks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">dbachecks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/dbatools/1.1.143\">dbatools on PowerShell Gallery</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/sql-server-management-objects-smo-programming-guide?view=sql-server-ver16&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">SQL Server Management Objects</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/learn-dbatools-in-a-month-of-lunches\">dbatools in a month of lunches</a></li><li><a href=\"https://runasradio.com/sqlbits\">RunAs at SQL Bits!</a></li></ul><p>Recorded January 10, 2023</p>\n",
