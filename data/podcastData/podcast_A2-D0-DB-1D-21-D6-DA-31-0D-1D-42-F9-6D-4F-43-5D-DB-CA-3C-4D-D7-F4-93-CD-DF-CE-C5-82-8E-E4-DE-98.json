    "Description": "<p>Students can build apps and collaboration skills at the same time. Today's episode features my friend Alefiya Master, the CEO of MAD-Learn, and the sponsor of today's show. We discuss the transformative role of app-building, collaborative learning, design thinking, and the importance of authentic learning experiences. Alefiya shares how app building can enhance STEM education and how it also teaches essential skills like teamwork, problem-solving, and passion-based learning. If you're doing collaborative projects and design in your classroom, you'll get practical ideas for how you can modify your projects to encourage collaboration and real-world learning.</p> <p>Show notes, transcript, and author bio: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e846\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e846</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Show Sponsor:\u00a0<a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/freetrialmadlearn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MAD-Learn</a>\u00a0is a free, easy tool for students to use to build apps of their own in a private space for just you and your students. You can publish it and share it with a limited audience, or design something bigger. When people ask me my favorite App-building tool, I always say MAD-Learn. MAD-Learn is an amazing collaborative app building tool. Not only have I used MAD-Learn for the first global collaborative app-building project, I love having my students build together and host a \"shark tank competition.\" I love how my students can edit together but can also view live changes on their smartphones using a QR code demo that is still private just to them and me. Their site is full of every presentation, rubric, and even a full curricuulm to teach design thinking and app building.
