    "Description": "<p>In 2012, Elvis Chidera wrote his first app on a Nokia feature (J2ME) phone. He wrote the Java App ON the phone (literally writing the Java code with T9 text on a numeric keypad.) Today, he's an Android developer at dotlearn.io who has worked on over 50 apps and currently works for an MIT startup. He chats with Scott about the Nigerian mobile market, how feature phones work, and where Android is headed.</p>\n",
