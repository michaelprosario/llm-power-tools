    "Description": "<p>Matt Greenwood, Chief Innovation Officer & Head of Investment Management Engineering @ Two Sigma shares some of the most unique and valuable cultural practices behind how the engineering org operates at Two Sigma. We discuss strategies that prepare you for scaling (like intentional relationship-building with your front-line managers); examples of how Two Sigma successfully deployed the \u201cInverse Conway Maneuver,\u201d how to reinforce a consensus-driven culture from early-days to 1000+, how to navigate both large & small reorgs; and why Two Sigma made the intentional decision to rebrand their R&D org as M&E (modeling & engineering)! Plus, Matt\u2019s approach to full-bodied problem-solving.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-greenwood-aa8741/\"><strong>MATT GREENWOOD</strong></a></h2><p>Matt is Chief Innovation Officer and Head of Investment Management Engineering at Two Sigma.

Silicon Alley, as they called it back then was just kaput. Then one day, I was browsing Craigslist, because that's what you did in 2003, and there was a little ad, \u2018Hedge fund, looking for excellent engineers.\u2019 So I was like, 'All right, maybe.' I said to my wife, 'This is either the sketchiest thing ever or the best decision of my life. It's one of those two things.' On Craigslist, there's no other way you can be, right? And it was probably the best decision of my life.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Matt Greenwood \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://incident.io/\">incident.io</a> is trusted by hundreds of tech-led companies across the globe, including Etsy, <a href=\"http://monday.com/\">monday.com</a>, Skyscanner and more to seamlessly orchestrate incident response from start to finish.
