    "Description": "<p>Have you looked at Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS)? Richard chats with Cameron Fuller about OMS and its relationship with System Center Operations Manager - other than caring about operations, they aren't the same thing at all. Cameron discusses the cloud-centric nature of OMS, but not necessarily an Azure-centric view: OMS can help with instrumentation and management of Amazon's cloud as well as other platforms as a whole. While OMS will integrate with Operations Manager, it will also take data from Nagios, which is a great instrumentation system from the open source world. The conversation also digs into different approaches to automation and backup - OMS covers a ton of important functionality!</p>\n",
