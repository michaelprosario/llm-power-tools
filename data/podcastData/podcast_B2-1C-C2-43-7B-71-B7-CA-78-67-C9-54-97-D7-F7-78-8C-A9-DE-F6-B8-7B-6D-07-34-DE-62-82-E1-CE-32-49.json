Discover how 90% of brain development happens before age five and why relationships are fundamental to learning. Hau's book \"Love to Learn\" (the #1 new release on Amazon in Early Childhood Education) reveals why we need more \"relational intelligence\" in education and less focus on standardized metrics. She explains why young children today play 50% less outdoors than their parents did and how early childhood educators are literally \"sculpting brains.\" A must-listen for anyone passionate about early childhood education!</p> <p>Show notes, bio, and infographic at <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e889\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e889</a></p> <p>Solution Tree - Show Sponsor</p> <p>For over 25 years, <a href= \"https://www.SolutionTree.com/10MinuteTeacher\">Solution Tree</a> has partnered with schools and districts to deliver research-driven professional development that helps teachers turn their passion into real progress for their students.
