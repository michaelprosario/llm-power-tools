    "Description": "When William Jeffries had to think of a project to work on as a bootcamp student, he decided to build an app that could detect and report temperatures in apartments when they dropped below a certain degree. His mission was to help people find heat in the winter, and he called it Heat Seek. In a few months, his student project grew past the classroom walls, getting the attention of city officals, entrepreneurs, and citizens excited to help. William tells us how the technology works, how he built the app as he was learning to code himself, and about the mindset that helped him get through the doubts many newbies face.
