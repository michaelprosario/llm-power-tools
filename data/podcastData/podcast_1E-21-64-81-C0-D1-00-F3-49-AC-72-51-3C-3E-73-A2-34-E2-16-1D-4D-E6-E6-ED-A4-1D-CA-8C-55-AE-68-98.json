    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of <em>The Double Win Show</em>, Michael Hyatt and Megan Hyatt Miller chat with Rich Litvin, bestselling author of <em>The Prosperous Coach</em> and sought-after leadership coach. Rich unpacks how leaders can embrace self-awareness, tackle work addiction, and redefine success by asking one simple but life-changing question: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p><br>Memorable Quotes</p><ol><li>\u201cMost of success is actually about mining your past.\u201d</li><li>\u201cNo one really remembers a comfortable life.\u201d</li><li>\u201cMy favorite coaching question is the simplest one. It\u2019s: What do you want? Especially if you\u2019re really good at helping other people, it\u2019s actually really hard to answer for yourself.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThe most underrated skill in leadership is self-awareness.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThe power of great coaching is that you can see things that others can\u2019t see. And you\u2019re bold enough to say what others won\u2019t dare to say.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be better at what they do than they are. They\u2019re the best in the planet at what they do. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s bold enough to challenge their thinking.\u201d</li><li>\u201cIf your heart tells you to <em>say this </em>to <em>do this</em>, then you need to lean into that edge, even if it\u2019s to start off by saying, \u2018Hey, I feel a little bit nervous to say this.\u2019\u201d</li><li>\u201cIf you\u2019re addicted to alcohol, to drugs, to sex, to the internet, there\u2019s all sorts of help you can get to support you. If you\u2019re addicted to work, everything is set up to support you in doing more of it.\u201d</li><li>\u201cYou need things that nurture your spirit. And as much as doing work that you love can feel great, it doesn\u2019t always nurture your soul.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWe\u2019re not stronger than that algorithm. We can\u2019t be. So we need ways to support.\u201d</li></ol><p><br>Key Takeaways</p><ol><li><strong>Ask \u201cWhat Do You Want?\u201d</strong> This simple yet powerful question unlocks clarity and reveals what truly matters.</li><li><strong>Self-Awareness Fuels Success.</strong> Great leaders reflect on their actions and embrace honest feedback to grow.</li><li><strong>Energy Drives Achievement.</strong> Identify what energizes or drains you to create more capacity for meaningful work.</li><li><strong>Growth Comes From Discomfort.</strong> The most fulfilling moments come when you step outside your comfort zone.</li><li><strong>Presence Nourishes the Soul.</strong> Activities like walking, reading, or connecting with loved ones demand your full attention and lead to greater fulfillment.</li><li><strong>Community Accelerates Growth.</strong> Honest, supportive relationships amplify self-awareness and help you thrive.</li></ol><p><br>Resources</p><ul><li>Rich Litvin\u2019s Website: <a href=\"https://www.richlitvin.com/\">richlitvin.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Prosperous-Coach-Increase-Income-Clients/dp/1600250300\"><em>The Prosperous Coach</em></a> by Rich Litvin and Steve Chandler</li><li>Rich Litvin\u2019s <a href=\"https://richlitvin.com/1-insight/\"><em>1 Insight</em></a> Podcast</li></ul><p><br>Watch on YouTube at:\u00a0 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-xmywu_fDi0\">https://youtu.be/-xmywu_fDi0</a></p><p>This episode was produced by Sarah Vorhees Wendel of VW Sound</p><p><br></p>\n      ",
