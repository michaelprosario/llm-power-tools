    "Description": "<p>Time for a holiday season show and a look back at the year! Richard chats with Microsoft Technical Fellow Jeffrey Snover about the very good year that Microsoft has had in most aspects. Jeff talks about how Azure came of age in 2018 and is leading the industry today - and heck, Microsoft even jumped up to be the highest market cap company in the world, at least for now. Looking beyond Windows, the various products that work with Linux and even Microsoft's own Linux distro in the form of Azure Sphere speak to a new Microsoft world. What will happen in 2019?</p>\n",
