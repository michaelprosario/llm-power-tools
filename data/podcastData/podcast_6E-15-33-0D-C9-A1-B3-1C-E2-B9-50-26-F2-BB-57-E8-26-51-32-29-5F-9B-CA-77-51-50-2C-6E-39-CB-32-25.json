    "Description": "<p>When it comes to carbon emissions, there\u2019s a major culprit you might not have heard about: cement. The production of cement emits almost as much carbon dioxide as cars do - but Brimstone CEO and co-founder Cody Finke says they\u2019ve found a way to change that.</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab, Cody explains where all that carbon dioxide is coming from, and how swapping out a key ingredient in the production of cement could take it from carbon-intensive \u2026 to carbon-negative.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng with music by Ramtin Arablouei.&nbsp;</p><p>It was edited by John Isabella with research help from J.C. Howard.
