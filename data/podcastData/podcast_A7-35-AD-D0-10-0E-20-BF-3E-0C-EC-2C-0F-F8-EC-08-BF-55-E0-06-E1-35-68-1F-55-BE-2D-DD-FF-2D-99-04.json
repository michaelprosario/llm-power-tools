    "Description": "<p>Working as a Hollywood makeup artist in the early 2000s, Rea Ann Silva designed a sponge that reshaped the face of beauty. She'd been looking for a technique to simplify makeup touch-ups without worrying about the smudges or streaks that were easily detected on HDTV. Her solution?&nbsp;A teardrop-shaped sponge\u2014hand-cut from a foam wedge\u2014that could apply makeup from any angle, and absorb just enough water to be extra-efficient.&nbsp;Actors and fellow makeup artists raved about the sponge, so Rea Ann cold-called an industry insider\u2014who almost hung up on her before agreeing to listen to her idea.&nbsp;That call led to a fruitful partnership that helped Rea Ann launch Beautyblender in Hollywood pro shops, then Ulta and Sephora.&nbsp;Today, the bright pink teardrop sponge is at the center of a multi-million-dollar beauty brand, available in over 50 countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
