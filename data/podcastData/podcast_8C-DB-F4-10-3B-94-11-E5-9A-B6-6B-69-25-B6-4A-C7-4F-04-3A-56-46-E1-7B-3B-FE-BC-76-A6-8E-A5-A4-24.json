This practice fostered a shared understanding of customer needs and amplified creativity within the team. A great PO promotes collaboration and ensures that the team is aligned with the product vision, enabling innovative solutions and meaningful outcomes.</p>   The Bad Product Owner: The Messenger Anti-Pattern, When Product Owners Lack Authority <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  A poor PO, Ellen explains, is one who lacks decision-making authority.

Ellen underscores that Scrum Masters play a crucial role in supporting POs to ensure they can fulfill their responsibilities effectively.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  How can you support Product Owners to strengthen their ability to make informed decisions?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  [The Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast Recommends]</p>   \ud83d\udd25In the ruthless world of fintech, success isn\u2019t just about innovation\u2014it\u2019s about coaching!\ud83d\udd25 <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Angela thought she was just there to coach a team.
