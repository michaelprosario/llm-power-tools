    "Description": "<p>Are you ready to move your intranet into the cloud? Richard talks to Susan Hanley about her work helping organizations migrate intranets into Microsoft 365 Sharepoint Online. Susan talks about avoiding lift-and-shift implementations for intranets - or anything going to the cloud. Better to take what you have learned about your intranet and build a governance plan in M365 to migrate content piece by piece. The good news is most of your old SharePoint customizations are now built-in capabilities in SharePoint Online! The conversation also digs into building pages to replace documents and what should be searchable - an intranet migration is a great chance to build an even better intranet!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/connections\">Viva Connections</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/private-channels?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-10953\">Private Channels in Microsoft Teams</a></li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165\">SharePoint News Part</a></li></ul><p>Recorded January 6, 2023</p>\n",
