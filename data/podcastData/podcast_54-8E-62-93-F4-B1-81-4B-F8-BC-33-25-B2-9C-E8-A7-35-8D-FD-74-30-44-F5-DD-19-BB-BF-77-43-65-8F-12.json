Mira and her teams are pushing the frontiers of what neural networks can do, seeking to better understand the behavior of powerful AI systems and make them safer, and align them with human intentions and human values. Prior to joining OpenAI, she led the product and engineering teams at Leap Motion (VR/AR startup), and led the design, development, and launch of vehicle products at Tesla, including Model X.</p><blockquote><p>\"We've always wanted human helpers. We've always tried to build tools like since the beginning of life we've created tools. They're just such a natural thing and now this is different because it extends the range of our mental capabilities, of our creativity and intuition and imagination. So we are sort of exploring this new era where tools are helping us extend the range of our minds.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Mira Murati \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngavini/\"><strong>NAVEEN GAVINI</strong></a></h2><p>Naveen Gavini (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ngavini\">@ngavini</a>) is the SVP of Products at Pinterest, where he oversees all design and product efforts for both consumer and advertiser products.
