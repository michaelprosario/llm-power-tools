    "Description": "\n        <p>Sweetgreen\u2019s co-founder Jonathan Neman joins Guy on the Advice Line to answer questions from three early-stage founders. Plus, Sweetgreen\u2019s plans to automate salad assembly in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we meet Dini from Maryland, who's learning how to maintain her brand\u2019s character and product quality as her pie company scales. Next we hear from Matt in Massachusetts, who\u2019s leaning into success growing premium mushrooms for local chefs without getting too big, too fast. Then Joey in Chicago, owner of a restaurant specializing in fried chicken wings and fresh-cut fries, who\u2019s deciding whether to introduce new products or double down on what\u2019s already working.</p><p>Thank you to the founders of Dini\u2019s Divine Pies, Underground Mushroom Co. and Dak Dak Korean Wings for being part of the show. </p><p>If you\u2019d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one-minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you\u2019d like answered.
