Mark takes a humorous poke at the role of computing, cloud and sensors that should bring automated driving to fruition. Are we really ready for this tech? That's a big shift in the workforce, a change in the cost of technology and a change in how we all travel. What comes next? Meantime, Mark's life is changing too, what's next for him?</p>\n",
