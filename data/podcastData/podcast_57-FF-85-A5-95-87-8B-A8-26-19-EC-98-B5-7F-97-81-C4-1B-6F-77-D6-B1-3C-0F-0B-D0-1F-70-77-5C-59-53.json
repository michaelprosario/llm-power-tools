    "Description": "<p> Ben Dunphy studied international relations and had a short career in finance. Among other things, he co-authored a bill that eventually got passed in his state of New Hampshire.</p> <p>But Ben saw the writing on the wall \u2013 that technology was becoming one of the most powerful ways to affect change. He learned to code and moved to San Francisco, where he and I first met back in 2013.</p> <p>He built Real World React \u2013 a series of evening events and corporate training programs \u2013 and ultimately helped launched conferences like Reactathon and JAMstack conf. And now he's helping run the upcoming AI Engineer Summit.</p> <p>I talk with Ben about his journey into tech and the lessons he's learned along the way. And if you're considering creating a tech event in your city, boy has Ben got some tips for you.</p> <p>I hope you're digging these weekly freeCodeCamp podcasts. Be sure to leave us a review.
