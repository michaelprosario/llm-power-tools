With three teams and one Product Owner, goals often diverged, and communication barriers arose. A key challenge emerged when the dev lead, fearing judgment over code quality, began personally reviewing code before client submission. This approach, initially manageable with five members, became overwhelming as the team grew. Despite efforts to coach the dev lead, the fear-driven behavior persisted, revealing the difficult balance of knowing when to push for change versus when to accept limits.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Self-reflection Question:  When coaching others, how do you recognize the point at which your influence may no longer be effective?</p>   Featured Book of the Week:  The Culture Map  by Erin Meyer <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Gosia highlights <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4ere7aR\"> The Culture Map</a>  as an essential read for understanding and navigating cultural differences within diverse organizations.
