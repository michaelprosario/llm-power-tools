    "Description": "<p>Tobi L\u00fctke, CEO and founder of the Canadian multinational e-commerce platform Shopify, is always looking for the tools he can use to build a better company. Since his early days running an online snowboard shop from his carport, Tobi has envisioned himself as fundamentally a craftsman first and a business exec second, a mindset that he has used to solve a wide variety of problems over the course of his career. In this episode, he joins Kevin to talk about applying computer science and engineering techniques to build and scale a company, the idea of bringing an \u2018apprentice mindset\u2019 to his work, and\u00a0how his daily practice of writing code and tinkering in his home lab inspires him to be a more creative leader.\u00a0</p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiaslutke/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tobi L\u00fctke</a> | <a href= \"https://www.shopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Shopify</a>\u00a0\u00a0</p>   <p><a href= \"https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.microsoft.com%2Fexec%2Fkevin-scott%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cmieshabaker%40microsoft.com%7C48cbce1b945d46a68be808dad8a390fc%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638060494271041427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=31YjjtI%2F0rQtoSjep8disjzKUj%2FGo52qR7PD1PYGEJE%3D&reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kevin Scott</a>\u202f\u00a0</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/behind-the-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Behind the Tech with Kevin Scott</a>\u202f\u00a0</p>   <p>Discover and listen to other <a href= \"https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/podcasts-and-shows/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft podcasts</a>.\u202f\u202f\u00a0</p> ",
