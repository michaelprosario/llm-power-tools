Or, what do you do if your struggling children need their mom, but you\u2019re too busy to be available to them?</p><p>In this debut of The Double Win, Michael Hyatt and Megan Hyatt Miller highlight their mission to help busy high-achievers win at both work and life.

They outline the structure of the new show featuring expert guests like branding expert and coach Donald Miller, Patrick Lencioni, and Kris Carr, talking about winning in the nine domains of life: body, mind, spirit, love, family, community, money, work, and hobbies. It\u2019s possible to balance professional success and personal fulfillment, and the Double Win Show can point the way.</p><p>Watch this episode on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2D3PkhOjqXs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/2D3PkhOjqXs</a></p><p>For complete show notes, visit <a href=\"http://doublewinshow.com/podcast/1-defining-the-double-win-win-at-work-and-succeed-at-life/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doublewinshow.com/podcast/1-defining-the-double-win-win-at-work-and-succeed-at-life/</a></p><p>Take your FREE LifeScore Assessment at <a href=\"http://doublewinshow.com/lifescore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doublewinshow.com/lifescore</a>.</p><p>Join Michael Hyatt for his free webinar: Land More Coaching Clients, Transform Lives, &amp; Stand Out in a Crowded Market.
