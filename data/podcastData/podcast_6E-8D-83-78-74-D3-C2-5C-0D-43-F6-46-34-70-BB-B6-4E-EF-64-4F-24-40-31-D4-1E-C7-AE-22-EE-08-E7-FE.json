    "Description": "<p>When Ary\u00e9 Elfenbein and Justin Kolbeck met in 2011, they had no intention of starting a business. Ary\u00e9 was a cardiologist, and Justin was a diplomat who had lived in countries all over the world. But their chance meeting at a dinner party led to a deep friendship focused on working together to change the world. Through regular Saturday morning brainstorming sessions, they settled on pursuing a scientific approach to growing meat for human consumption.</p><p>This week on <em>How I Built This Lab</em>, Ary\u00e9 and Justin discuss the problems with modern seafood production and how their company, Wildtype, hopes to revolutionize the industry by using stem cells to cultivate real, sushi-grade salmon... without harming any actual fish.</p><p>This episode was produced by Chris Maccini and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
