    "Description": "<p>Neel Nanda, a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind, leads their mechanistic interpretability team. In this extensive interview, he discusses his work trying to understand how neural networks function internally. At just 25 years old, Nanda has quickly become a prominent voice in AI research after completing his pure mathematics degree at Cambridge in 2020.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Nanda reckons that machine learning is unique because we create neural networks that can perform impressive tasks (like complex reasoning and software engineering) without understanding how they work internally. He compares this to having computer programs that can do things no human programmer knows how to write. His work focuses on \"mechanistic interpretability\" - attempting to uncover and understand the internal structures and algorithms that emerge within these networks.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>SPONSOR MESSAGES:</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>CentML offers competitive pricing for GenAI model deployment, with flexible options to suit a wide range of models, from small to large-scale deployments. </p>\n<p>https://centml.ai/pricing/</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Tufa AI Labs is a brand new research lab in Zurich started by Benjamin Crouzier focussed on ARC and AGI, they just acquired MindsAI - the current winners of the ARC challenge.
