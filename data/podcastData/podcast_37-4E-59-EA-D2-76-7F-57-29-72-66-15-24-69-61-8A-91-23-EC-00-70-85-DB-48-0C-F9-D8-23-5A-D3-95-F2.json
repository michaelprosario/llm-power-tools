Brought in to replace a beloved Scrum Master, he found himself navigating a strained relationship between the Product Owner (PO) and the team. The PO's aggressive push for deliverables demotivated the team, and management sided with the PO, creating a vicious cycle of disengagement. How can a PO's leadership style make or break a team's performance? Richard explores this anti-pattern of PO-driven disengagement.</p>   Featured Book of the Week: Lean Enterprise by Jez Humble, et al. <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  Richard reflects on how the book <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/3XN7Zos\"> \"Lean Enterprise\"</a>  helped shape his approach as an Agile Coach, offering a holistic view of organizations. He also discusses <a style= \"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2020/03/podcast/bonus-how-to-setup-agile-and-devops-teams-team-topologies-interview-with-matthew-skelton-and-manuel-pais/\">  \"Team Topologies\"</a>  and the importance of stream-aligned teams with CI/CD pipelines. What role does organizational agility play in the success of Scrum teams? Richard suggests that while many teams practice Scrum, organizations themselves are often not truly Agile.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  [IMAGE HERE] Do you wish you had decades of experience?
