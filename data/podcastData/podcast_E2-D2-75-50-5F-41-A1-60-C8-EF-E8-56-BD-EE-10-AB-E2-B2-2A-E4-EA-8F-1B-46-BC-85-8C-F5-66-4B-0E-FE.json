    "Description": "<p>Tune in to listen to Sam\u00ed Haiman-Merrero who is the CEO and founder of URBANDER.\u00a0 I loved this guest. We got to know her on a more personal level.\u00a0 What is cool, is that Sam\u00ed is one of the nation\u2019s leading experts specializing in the U.S. Hispanic market. Her career started over 25 years ago working in Public Relations, Marketing and Publishing companies headquartered in New York City. Career highlights include handling the first-ever Spanish language media effort for a U.S. Presidential candidate which led to winning the highly coveted Hispanic vote in 1996, becoming the Publisher of a national Spanish-language magazine, and being interviewed by international, national and regional media such as The Wall Street Journal, El Nuevo D\u00eda (Puerto Rico), Huffington Post, MSNBC, Florida Trend magazine, NBCnews.com, and Canada\u2019s CBC News, regarding the Latino experience in the U.S.</p>\n",
