    "Description": "<p>Mike Fiedler, a PyPI safety and security engineer at the Python Software Foundation, prefers the title \u201ccode gardener,\u201d reflecting his role in maintaining and securing open source projects. Recorded at PyCon US, Fiedler explains his task of \u201cpulling the weeds\u201d in code\u2014handling unglamorous but crucial aspects of open source contributions. Since August, funded by Amazon Web Services, Fiedler has focused on enhancing the security of the Python Package Index (PyPI). His efforts include ensuring that both packages and the pipeline are secure, emphasizing the importance of vetting third-party modules before deployment.</p><p>One of Fiedler\u2019s significant initiatives was enforcing mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for all PyPI user accounts by January 1, following a community awareness campaign. This transition was smooth, thanks to proactive outreach. Additionally, the foundation collaborates with security researchers and the public to report and address malicious packages.</p><p>In late 2023, a security audit by Trail of Bits, funded by the Open Technology Fund, identified and quickly resolved medium-sized vulnerabilities, increasing PyPI's overall security. More details on Fiedler's work are available in the full interview video.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about PyPl:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/pypi-strives-to-pull-itself-out-of-trouble/\">PyPl Strives to Pull Itself Out of Trouble</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-python-is-evolving/\">How Python Is Evolving</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/poisoned-lolip0p-pypi-packages/ \">Poisoned Lolip0p PyPI Packages</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
