    "Description": "At the time of this recording, the New York Times released a report titled \"As Cameras Track Detroit\u2019s Residents a Debate Ensues Over Racial Bias,\" which discussed some of the issues in machine learning such as algorithmic bias, and facial recognition software giving more false matches for black people than white people. We chat with Nashlie Sephus, CTO of Partpic, which was acquired by Amazon in 2016, and now an Applied Science Manager at Amazon Web Services, about her journey into machine learning, developing Partpic, and tackling some of the ethical issues in machine learning in her new role at Amazon.
