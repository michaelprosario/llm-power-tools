Most of all, it asks: what if, in the future, everything breaks humanity\u2019s way? Hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger, each episode features an interview with a visionary from a different field: climate science, media, criminal justice, and more. The conversation also features another kind of guest: GPT-4, OpenAI\u2019s latest and most powerful language model to date. Each episode has a companion story, generated by GPT-4, which will serve as a jumping-off point for a hopeful, speculative discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology\u2014and our collective effort\u2014effectively.</li></ul><p><strong>This episode wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the help of our incredible production team:</strong></p><p>Patrick Gallagher - Producer & Co-Host</p><p>Jerry Li - Co-Host</p><p>Noah Olberding - Associate Producer, Audio & Video Editor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-olberding/</a></p><p>Dan Overheim - Audio Engineer, Dan\u2019s also an avid 3D printer - <a href=\"https://www.bnd3d.com/\">https://www.bnd3d.com/</a></p><p>Ellie Coggins Angus - Copywriter, Check out her other work at <a href=\"https://elliecoggins.com/about/\">https://elliecoggins.com/about/</a></p>\n",
