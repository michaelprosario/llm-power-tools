    "Description": "\n        <p>Growing up in the \u201880s in New Jersey, Marc Ecko loved hip hop, graffiti art, and painting t-shirts for friends. His passion soon bloomed into a full-on business: ECKO UNLTD, a streetwear brand known for its iconic rhino logo. By the 1990\u2019s, the brand had become a cultural force, but not without its share of bad deals, daunting debt, and a close brush with bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p><p>Eager to keep innovating, Marc launched COMPLEX, a media company hyper-focused on \u201cconvergence\u201d culture: hip hop, fashion, sports and pop culture. Within a decade, COMPLEX had weathered the financial crisis, and emerged profitable. After being bought\u2013and sold\u2013by Buzzfeed, it was purchased by a video shopping company for over $100 million, and ECKO UNLTD just celebrated its 30th anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was researched and produced by Katherine Sypher with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
