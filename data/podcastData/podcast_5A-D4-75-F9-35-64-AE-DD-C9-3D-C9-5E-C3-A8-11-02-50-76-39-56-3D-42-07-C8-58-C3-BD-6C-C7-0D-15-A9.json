    "Description": "\n        The former CEO of Zappos, Tony Hsieh has died. He was 46 years old. We are grateful that Tony shared his story with us in 2017 and we are republishing it as a tribute to his life and career. Tony was a computer scientist whose first company made millions off the dot-com boom. But he didn't make his mark until he built Zappos\u2014a customer service company that \"happens to sell shoes.\" Tony stepped down as CEO of Zappos in August 2020; the company is worth over a billion dollars and is known for its  unorthodox management style.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n      ",
