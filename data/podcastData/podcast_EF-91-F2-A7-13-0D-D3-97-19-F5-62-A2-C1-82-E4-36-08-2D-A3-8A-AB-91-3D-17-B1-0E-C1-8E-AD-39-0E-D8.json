Her expertise and perspective have been featured in Built In SF and the podcasts Stayin\u2019 alive in Technology, Dev Interrupted, and CTO Connection.</p><p>As a lifelong soccer player, Heidi\u2019s often on the pitch; she\u2019s also an avid hiker, bicyclist, and kayaker. She once hiked with her husband across England, 192 miles coast to coast (with B&Bs and pub stops along the way).</p><p>Heidi studied at Brown University, where she earned a BS in computer science. She also attended Stanford University\u2019s Executive Institute.</p><blockquote><p>And so now you have this chasm where we'd have these weird conversations around what machine learning features should we build for Grammarly business? And neither side could understand what the other person's context was to come up with an idea.</p></blockquote><p>We struggled with that for a little bit until we really just put people in a room and, and it did exactly that. We said, \"Here is the user research, five critical communication challenges within a company. You know what technology you have. You know how organizations work. Get together and just talk about, you know, your peanut butter, your chocolate. What can we make here? Let's have a Reese Peanut butter cup...!\"</p><p>-Heidi Williams</p><h2>Interested in joining an <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">ELC Peer Group?</a></h2><p>ELCs <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\">Peer Groups</a> provide a virtual, curated, and ongoing peer learning opportunity to help you navigate the unknown, uncover solutions and accelerate your learning with a small group of trusted peers.</p><p><strong>Apply to join a peer group HERE:</strong> <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01tssg60\"><strong>sfelc.com/peerGroups</strong></a></p><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Heidi\u2019s favorite \u201cstartup-within-a-startup\u201d moments with Grammarly & Grammarly Business (1:56)</li><li>What you can learn from the \u201cPDF as MVP\u201d approach (4:36)</li><li>How early conversations impacted the final product & eng team functions (5:40)</li><li>The benefits of building a startup-within-a-startup (9:21)</li><li>Considerations when making the decision to become a multi-product company (11:19)</li><li>Identifying the adjacencies within your current user base (13:24)</li><li>The difference between discovering a new market & building the next feature (14:32)</li><li>How to source new ideas & encourage innovation in your eng team (15:31)</li><li>Frameworks for communicating challenges across different teams / individuals (21:02)</li><li>Strategies for facilitating knowledge-sharing meetings (24:55)</li><li>Fostering a culture of healthy, positive idea jams (26:50)</li><li>Heidi\u2019s advice on the cadence of idea jams for a startup-within-a-startup (28:15)</li><li>What the execution / maturity pathway process looks like (29:49)</li><li>Heidi\u2019s hypothesis behind merging a product with the greater business (33:04)</li><li>How to navigate dependencies when your product is in the incubator phase (35:51)</li><li>Keys for determining the end game of a product \u2013 pathway to success or time to wind down?
