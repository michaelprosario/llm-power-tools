With over 25 years in software development leadership, Tricia shares her journey from an individual contributor to a transformative leader. The conversation touches on the challenges of giving up control, the importance of psychological safety, and how to foster resilient and empowered teams.</p>   The Red-Pen Apology: A Leadership Awakening <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Leadership isn't about doing everything yourself; it's about empowering others to excel.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Tricia reflects on a pivotal moment early in her career when she realized that her meticulous attention to detail was sending the wrong message to her team. She shares how this realization led to her \"red-pen apology,\" where she acknowledged her need to step up as a leader rather than continuing to act as an individual contributor. This was the beginning of her journey toward understanding the importance of giving up control to create a healthier, more scalable work environment.</p>   Overcoming the Challenge of Letting Go <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"If you want to lead effectively, you must be willing to let go of control and trust your team.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  One of the biggest challenges Tricia faced was learning to give up control\u2014a common struggle for leaders who transition from individual contributor roles. She discusses the lack of leadership role models and patterns available during her early career and how this shaped her understanding of effective leadership. Tricia emphasizes the importance of creating the right environment for collective decision-making and shares her insights on how to help other leaders learn these critical skills.</p>   Cultivating Psychological Safety in Leadership <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Psychological safety isn't a luxury; it's a necessity for team success.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Tricia highlights the importance of psychological safety in leadership, particularly in environments where power dynamics are at play. She shares practical tips for helping leaders recognize when their current methods aren't working and how to guide them toward learning new, sometimes uncomfortable skills. Tricia also discusses the need for transparency in leadership, recounting a moment when she realized the mixed messages she was sending about failure within her team.</p>   Resilience Factors: Building Blame-Free Teams <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"To avoid blame and shame, we must focus on resilience factors that empower teams to handle conflict healthily.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Tricia introduces the concept of resilience factors\u2014patterns and motivators that help teams avoid blame and shame while working together effectively. She discusses the importance of fostering healthy conversations about conflict and enabling teams to manage these situations independently. By paying attention to these resilience factors, leaders can create environments where teams are empowered and equipped to thrive.</p>   Measuring Success: Beyond the Numbers <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"Metrics should guide us, not define us. Focus on trends and the bigger picture.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  When it comes to KPIs, Tricia is cautious about relying too heavily on metrics, as they can sometimes negatively impact team morale. She emphasizes the importance of using a set of metrics to understand trends rather than focusing on individual numbers. Tricia also shares her approach to evaluating organizational health, customer impact, and individual contributions, stressing that metrics should align with key initiatives but not become the sole focus.</p>   Staying Ahead: Continuous Learning in Tech Leadership <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  \"To lead in tech, you must be committed to continuous learning and staying connected with industry trends.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">  Tricia shares how she stays up-to-date with industry trends, emerging technologies, and best practices in software engineering. She relies on a combination of conferences, networking, and books to inform her decision-making. Tricia also discusses how certain books, like <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href= \"https://amzn.to/4dYUPK3\"> The Five Dysfunctions of a Team  by Patrick Lencioni</a>, have influenced her leadership approach, particularly in creating environments that foster trust and collaboration.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  [IMAGE HERE]  Retrospectives, planning sessions, vision workshops, we are continuously helping teams learn about how to collaborate in practice!
