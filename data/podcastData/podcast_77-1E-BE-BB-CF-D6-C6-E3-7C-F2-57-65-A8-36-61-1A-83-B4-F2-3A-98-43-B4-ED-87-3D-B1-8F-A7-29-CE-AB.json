    "SourceUrl": "https://www.runasradio.com/",
    "Description": "<p>Clint Huffman is back! Richard and Greg talk to Microsoft Premier Field Engineer Clint Huffman about performance tuning Hyper-V. Clint works out in the field with customers solving the problems they have with Hyper-V. He gives us a raft of tips on how to understand what Hyper-V is doing, including avoiding the Task Manager entirely (it'll lie to you) and focusing instead of Performance Monitor and xPerf. He also points us to Tony Voellm's blog at http://blogs.msdn.com/tvoellm. Also check out this article on Performance Tuning Hyper-V and BizTalk written by Clint and Ewan Fairweather.</p>\n",
