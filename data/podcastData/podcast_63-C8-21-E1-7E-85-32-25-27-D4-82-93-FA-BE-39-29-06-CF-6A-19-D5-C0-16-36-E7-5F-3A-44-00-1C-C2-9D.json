    "Description": "\n        <p>From a coffee cart parked uneasily in a grocery parking lot, Travis and Dane Boersma grew Dutch Bros into a sprawling chain of 700-plus beverage restaurants. Before they got started in Grants Pass, Oregon, in 1992, Dane had never tried espresso, and neither brother knew how to make it. But with the help of nearby experts, they learned the craft\u2014and even improvised their own recipes, like mocha made with chocolate milk from a local dairy. Eventually, Dutch Bros would go from pushcarts to drive-throughs, and from small-town Oregon to Wall Street\u2014with a nearly $500-million IPO in 2021. Along the way, the brothers\u2019 special connection carried them through good times and bad, until an unexpected family tragedy shook the business to its core.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng, with music by Ramtin Arablouei</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Katherine Sypher.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
