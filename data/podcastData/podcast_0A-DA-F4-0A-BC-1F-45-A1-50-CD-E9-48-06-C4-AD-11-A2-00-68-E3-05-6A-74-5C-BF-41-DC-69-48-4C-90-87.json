    "Description": "<p><p>In this episode of The New Stack\u2019s On the Road show at Open Source Summit in Austin, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliaferraioli/\">Julia Ferraioli</a>, open source technical leader at <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com\">Cisco\u2019s</a> open source programs office, spoke with The New Stack about some alternative ways to define what is and is not \u2018open source.\u2019 <br /><br />When someone says, well, that\u2019s \u2018technically\u2019 open source, it\u2019s usually to be snarky about a project that meets the legal criteria to be open source, but doesn\u2019t follow the spirit of open source. Ferraioli doesn\u2019t think that the \u2018classic\u2019 open source project, like a Kubernetes or Linux, are the only valid models for open source. She gives the sample of a research project \u2014 the code might be open sourced specifically so that others can see the code and reproduce the results themselves. However, for the research to remain valid, they it can\u2019t accept any contributions.<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s no less open source than others,\u201d Ferraioli said about the hypothetical research project. \u201cIf you break things down by purpose, it\u2019s not always that you\u2019re trying to build the robust community.\u201d The social model of open source, Ferraioli says, is about understanding the different use cases for open source, as well as providing a framework for determining what appropriate success metrics could be depending on what the project\u2019s motivations are. And if you\u2019re just doing a project with friends for laughs, well, quantifying fun isn\u2019t going to be easy.</p></p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
