    "Description": "<p>Cookware is a $73 billion global industry - awash in all kinds of pots and pans. Like, if you\u2019ve ever cooked scrambled eggs, you've probably used a non-stick frying pan. They\u2019re inexpensive and everywhere. But they\u2019ve been dogged by complaints: many can\u2019t handle high heat, like broiling or searing, and they&nbsp;scratch easily.&nbsp;So, when Danny Winer came across a new non-stick technology at a trade show overseas, he jumped on it, co-founding Hexclad with a buddy. Danny was convinced it could be adapted to the U.S. market - and be a hit. He was right! In just under ten years, Hexclad grew into a $500 million company.</p><p>This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
