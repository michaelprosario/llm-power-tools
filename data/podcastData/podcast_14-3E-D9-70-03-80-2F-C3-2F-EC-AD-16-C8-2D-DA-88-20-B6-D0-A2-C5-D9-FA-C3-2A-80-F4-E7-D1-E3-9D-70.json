    "Description": "Baratunde Thurston\u2019s made a career of combining tech, comedy, and politics. From launching Comedy Hack Day to his recent role as the Daily Show\u2019s first Supervising Producer for Digital Expansion, he\u2019s found innovative ways to use code as a tool for satire, entertainment, and activism. In part I of our interview, he tells us why he started as a computer science major but ended with a philosophy degree instead, how he sees satirical apps as technology\u2019s art-form, and how projects like Comedy Hack Day bring people together for a unique, and highly entertaining, coding experience.
