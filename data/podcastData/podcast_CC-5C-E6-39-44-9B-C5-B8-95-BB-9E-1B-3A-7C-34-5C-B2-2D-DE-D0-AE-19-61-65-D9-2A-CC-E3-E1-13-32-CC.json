    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Dorian Develops. He's a software engineer and prolific YouTube creator.\u00a0</p> <p>Dorian grew up in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami. He's the child of a single mother that arrived as a refugee from Cuba. After a rough childhood and dropping out of high school in 9th grade, Dorian eventually made a living as a valet car parker in Las Vegas. It was here that he realized he needed to make changes for the sake of his family's future.</p> <p>Dorian taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp and other free learning resources, and has since gotten several 6-figure jobs as a web developer.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How Dorian survived his 20s by waiting tables and parking cars in Las Vegas</p> <p>- How he taught himself to code using free learning resources and built his network through months of attending local developer meetups</p> <p>- How he's worked as a remote developer so he and his kids can travel the world</p> <p>- And how he's 1 year into his recovery from a lifetime of drug and alcohol addiction</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 10,993 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
