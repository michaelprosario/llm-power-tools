    "Description": "<p>Students, parents, and teachers have social emotional learning skills that are needed in today's climate. Dr. Amy Cranston helps us understand how we can help our children (and families and schools) make it through this difficult time.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e661\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e662</a></p> <p class=\"p1\">Sponsor: In today\u2019s challenging times, we know how critical it is to make sure kids are equipped with social and emotional learning skills to cope with the world around them. That's why I\u2019m excited to highlight the WE Schools Program, made possible by The Allstate Foundation. It brings social and emotional learning together with service-learning, helping children build key skills such as resilience, empathy, perseverance and problem-solving.
