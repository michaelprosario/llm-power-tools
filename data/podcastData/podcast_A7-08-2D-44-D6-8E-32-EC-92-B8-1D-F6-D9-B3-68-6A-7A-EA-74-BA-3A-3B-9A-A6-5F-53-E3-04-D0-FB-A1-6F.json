    "Description": "<p>Dr. Patrick Lewis is a London-based AI and Natural Language Processing Research Scientist, working at co:here. Prior to this, Patrick worked as a research scientist at the Fundamental AI Research Lab (FAIR) at Meta AI. During his PhD, Patrick split his time between FAIR and University College London, working with Sebastian Riedel and Pontus Stenetorp.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patrick\u2019s research focuses on the intersection of information retrieval techniques (IR) and large language models (LLMs). He has done extensive work on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models. His current focus is on building more powerful, efficient, robust, and update-able models that can perform well on a wide range of NLP tasks, but also excel on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks such as Question Answering and Fact Checking.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>YT version: https://youtu.be/Dm5sfALoL1Y</p>\n<p>MLST Discord: https://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5</p>\n<p>Support us! https://www.patreon.com/mlst</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Patrick Lewis (Natural Language Processing Research Scientist @ co:here)</p>\n<p>https://www.patricklewis.io/</p>\n<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks (Patrick Lewis et al)</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401</p>\n<p>Atlas: Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models (Gautier Izacard, Patrick Lewis, et al)</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03299</p>\n<p>Improving language models by retrieving from trillions of tokens (RETRO) (Sebastian Borgeaud et al)</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04426</p>\n",
