    "Description": "<p>Does multi-cloud make sense? Richard chats with Phoummala Schmitt about her explorations into building workloads that can survive a cloud outage. Phoummala begins the conversation with some definitions because most organizations are multi-cloud already, using more than one cloud provider. Referencing Gartner and Thoughtworks, the term \"polycloud\" covers that idea. Then the hard part - a workload that needs perfect uptime, even in the face of a cloud provider outage. That is a more complex and expensive proposition, but it is possible once you work through the details. The question is - is it worth it?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-ca/insights/decoder/p/polycloud\">Polycloud</a></li><li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/\">Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager</a></li><li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-arc/\">Azure Arc</a></li></ul><p>Recorded February 16, 2023</p>\n",
