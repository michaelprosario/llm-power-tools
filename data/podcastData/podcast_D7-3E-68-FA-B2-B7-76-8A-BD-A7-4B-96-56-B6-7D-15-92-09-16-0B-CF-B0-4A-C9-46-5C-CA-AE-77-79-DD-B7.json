    "Description": "<p>Support us! https://www.patreon.com/mlst &nbsp;</p>\n<p>MLST Discord: https://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We are honoured to welcome Dr. Joel Lehman, an eminent machine learning research scientist, whose work in AI safety, reinforcement learning, creative open-ended search algorithms, and indeed the philosophy of open-endedness and abandoning objectives has paved the way for innovative ideas that challenge our preconceptions and inspire new visions for the future.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lehman's thought-provoking book, \"Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned\" penned with with our MLST favourite Professor Kenneth Stanley has left an indelible mark on the field and profoundly impacted the way we view innovation and the serendipitous nature of discovery. Those of you who haven't watched our special edition show on that, should do so at your earliest convenience! Building upon this foundation, Dr. Lehman has ventured into the domain of AI systems that embody principles of love, care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge, drawing from the works of Maslow, Erich Fromm, and positive psychology.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>YT version: https://youtu.be/23-TXgJEv-Q</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>http://joellehman.com/</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/joelbot3000</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Interviewer: Dr. Tim Scarfe</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>Intro [00:00:00]</p>\n<p>Model [00:04:26]</p>\n<p>Intro and Paper Intro [00:08:52]</p>\n<p>Subjectivity [00:16:07]</p>\n<p>Reflections on Greatness Book [00:19:30]</p>\n<p>Representing Subjectivity [00:29:24]</p>\n<p>Nagal's Bat [00:31:49]</p>\n<p>Abstraction [00:38:58]</p>\n<p>Love as Action Rather Than Feeling [00:42:58]</p>\n<p>Reontologisation [00:57:38]</p>\n<p>Self Help [01:04:15]</p>\n<p>Meditation [01:09:02]</p>\n<p>The Human Reward Function / Effective...
