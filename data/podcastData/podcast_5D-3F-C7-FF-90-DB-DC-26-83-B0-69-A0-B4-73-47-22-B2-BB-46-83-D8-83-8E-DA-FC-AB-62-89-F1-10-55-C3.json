    "Description": "<p>What is an effective way to prepare for a Python interview? Would you like a set of problems that increase in difficulty to practice and hone your Python skills?  This week on the show, we have Jim Anderson to talk about his new Real Python article, &ldquo;Python Practice Problems: Get Ready for Your Next Interview.&rdquo;  This article provides several problems, which include skeleton code, unit tests, and solutions for you to compare your work.</p>\n<p>David Amos also joins us this week, and he has brought another batch of PyCoder\u2019s Weekly articles and projects from the Python community. We cover these topics: Structural Pattern Matching, Common Python Data Structures, A Tax Attorney Uses Python, Discover the Role of Python in Space Exploration, and Five Pairs of Magic Methods in Python That You Should Know.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-stack/\">How to Implement a Python Stack</a> </p>\n<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll learn how to implement a Python stack. You&rsquo;ll see how to recognize when a stack is a good choice for data structures, how to decide which implementation is best for a program, and what extra considerations to make about stacks in a threading or multiprocessing environment.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\n<li>00:01:37 &ndash; Python Practice Problems</li>\n<li>00:08:19 &ndash; Structural Pattern Matching</li>\n<li>00:14:16 &ndash; Common Python Data Structures</li>\n<li>00:17:49 &ndash;   Video Course Spotlight</li>\n<li>00:18:42 &ndash; A Tax Attorney Uses Python</li>\n<li>00:23:36 &ndash; Discover the Role of Python in Space Exploration</li>\n<li>00:26:33 &ndash; Thanks for the Reviews!</li>\n<li>00:27:28 &ndash; 5 Pairs of Magic Methods in Python That You Should Know</li>\n<li>00:36:56 &ndash; python-adventure: Original Colossal Caves Adventure Game</li>\n<li>00:41:06 &ndash; clifford: Geometric Algebra for Python</li>\n<li>00:43:45 &ndash; pippi: Computer Music With Python</li>\n<li>00:46:24 &ndash; Thanks and Goodbye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-practice-problems/\">Python Practice Problems: Get Ready for Your Next Interview</a> &ndash; Are you a Python developer brushing up on your skills before an interview?
