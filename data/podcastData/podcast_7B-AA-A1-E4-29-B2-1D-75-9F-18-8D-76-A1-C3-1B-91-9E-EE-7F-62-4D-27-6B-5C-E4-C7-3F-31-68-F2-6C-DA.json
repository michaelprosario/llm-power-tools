    "Description": "\n        <p>Pete Warhurst probably would not have picked \u201centrepreneur\u201d as a career when he was growing up.&nbsp;He loved his job as a firefighter and paramedic and might have done it for life, had a colleague not recruited him to help launch a company to build 911 call systems. After that business sold,&nbsp;Pete began to think about new problems to solve \u2013 like a better way to move and store our stuff.&nbsp;In 1998, he began disrupting the self-storage industry with PODS, a system that brings storage containers to the consumer, then transfers them to a warehouse. The business quickly spread from Clearwater, Florida to franchises across the country, eventually selling for about $450 million.&nbsp;But Pete still thought there was a better way to schlep your stuff to a storage facility, so he launched yet another business\u2014Red Rover\u2014that now competes with PODS.&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
