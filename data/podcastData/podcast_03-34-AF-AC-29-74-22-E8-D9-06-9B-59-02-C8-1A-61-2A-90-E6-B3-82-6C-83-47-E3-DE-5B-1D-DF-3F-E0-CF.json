    "Description": "<p>This episode of The New Stack Makers was recorded on the road at the Linux Foundation\u2019s Open Source Summit Europe in Bilbao, Spain. A pair of technologists from Amazon Web Services (AWS) join us to discuss the development of Powertools for AWS Lambda. Andrea Amorosi, a senior solutions architect at AWS, and Leandro Damascena, a specialist solutions architect, share insights into how Powertools evolved from an observability tool to support more advanced use cases like ensuring workload safety, batch processing, streaming data, and idempotency.</p><p>Powertools primarily supports Python, TypeScript, Java, and .NET. The latest feature, idempotency for TypeScript, was introduced to help customers achieve best practices for developing resilient and fault-tolerant workloads. By integrating these best practices during the development phase, Powertools reduces the need for costly re-architecting and rewriting of code.</p><p>The success of Powertools can be attributed to its strong open source community, which fosters collaboration and contributions from users. AWS ensures transparency by conducting all project activities in the open, allowing anyone to understand and influence feature prioritization and contribute in various ways. Furthermore, the project's international support team offers assistance in multiple languages and time zones.</p><p>A noteworthy aspect is that 40% of new Powertools features have been contributed by the community, providing contributors with valuable networking opportunities at a prominent tech giant like AWS. Overall, Powertools demonstrates how open source principles can thrive within a major corporation, offering benefits to both the company and the open source community.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Powertools, Lambda, and Amazon Web Services:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/aws-offers-a-typescript-interface-for-lambda-observability/\">AWS Offers a TypeScript Interface for Lambda Observability</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-donating-open-source-code-can-advance-your-career/\">How Donating Open Source Code Can Advance Your Career</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/turn-aws-lambda-functions-stateful-with-amazon-elastic-file-system/\">Turn AWS Lambda Functions Stateful with Amazon Elastic File System</a></p>\n",
