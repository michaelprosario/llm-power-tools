    "Description": "<p>Kyle Stern <a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/stern_history\">@stern_history</a> uses Marvel's \"Civil War\" to teach Government Regulation. The test scores show it is working. Understand how a teacher can use graphic novels (a/k/a Comic Books) to meet standards, excite kids, and teach at the same time. It can be done! <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e133\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e133</a></p> <p>Today's sponsor is <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/discover\">Kids Discover</a>. They're doing awesome things to drive inquiry based learning. Check out <a href= \"http://coolcatteacher.com/discover\">coolcatteacher.com/discover</a> and see how the Kids Discover online platform lets students enter discovery mode. This fun, visual tool lets students explore 150 different science and social studies units for elementary and middle school learners. And while they can explore a wide variety of topics from the US Constitution to Ecology and Ancient China, I also like that you can assign these nonfiction texts and three different lexiles to supplement what you're doing in the classroom.
