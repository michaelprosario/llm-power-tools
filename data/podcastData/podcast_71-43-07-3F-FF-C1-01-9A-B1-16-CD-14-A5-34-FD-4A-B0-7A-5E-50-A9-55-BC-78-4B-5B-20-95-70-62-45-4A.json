    "Description": "<p>Valkey, an open-source fork of Redis launched in March, introduced its multithreaded Version 8.0 in September, now available through AWS ElastiCache. At All Things Open 2024 in Raleigh, AWS's Kyle Davis explains that Valkey was developed after Redis changed to a restrictive license, drawing contributors from companies like AWS, Google, Alibaba, and Oracle. Notably, some contributors emerged independently, including a significant contributor from Vietnam. Version 8.0 differentiates itself from Redis by leveraging multithreaded CPUs, addressing the efficiency of I/O operations in modern hardware. Additionally, data structure refinements were made to improve memory efficiency by up to 20%, particularly benefiting large-key databases.</p><p>Looking ahead, Valkey plans two annual updates, with the next release expected in 2025. New modules are anticipated, including a JSON module for efficient data manipulation and a Bloom filter for probabilistic data presence checks. Version 9.0 may bring substantial changes to clustering, updating it to better leverage modern technologies. The Valkey project aims to continue evolving its capabilities to meet the demands of advanced data storage needs.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Valkey:\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/valkey-is-a-different-kind-of-fork/ \">Valkey Is a Different Kind of Fork\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/aws-adds-support-drops-prices-for-redis-forked-valkey/ \">AWS Adds Support, Drops Prices, for Redis-Forked Valkey\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/valkey-a-redis-fork-with-a-future/ \">Valkey: A Redis Fork With a Future\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
