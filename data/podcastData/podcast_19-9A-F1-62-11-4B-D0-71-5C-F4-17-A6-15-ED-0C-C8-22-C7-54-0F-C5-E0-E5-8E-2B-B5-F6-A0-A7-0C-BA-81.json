Regardless of the business you\u2019re in, change is the only constant in today\u2019s marketplace. And if you want to survive, complacency is not an option. Tune in as Dave details the three things to avoid if you want to stay a step ahead of your competition. We\u2019ll also hear incredible testimonies from two of this year\u2019s 2,300 Summit attendees.
