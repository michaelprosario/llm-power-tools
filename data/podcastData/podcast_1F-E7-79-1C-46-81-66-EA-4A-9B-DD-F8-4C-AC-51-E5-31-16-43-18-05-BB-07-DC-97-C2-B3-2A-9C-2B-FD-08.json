    "Description": "<p>Scott's in Sweden and he sits down with well-known Software Tester James Bach to talk about what it means to be an unconventional learner. James has had success in the software industry even though he dropped out of school at age 14. His new book &quot;Secrets of a Buccaneer-Scholar&quot; explores the issue of nontraditional learning as it relates to success later in life. James is an interesting dude. I hope you enjoy the show.</p>\n",
