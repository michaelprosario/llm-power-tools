    "Description": "<p>As rapidly as notebook services are changing, it is so important that its worth the risk. Today, I'll share six apps for digital note-taking and my experiences with each of them. I'll also give you a peek at my first testing of Google NotebookLM. I'll also give you tips on creating a workflow that works for you.</p> <p>The apps I'm covering in today's \"Tech Tool Tuesday\" include Evernote, Notion, OneNote, LogSeek, Apple Notes, and Google Keep as well as Google NotebookLM. We all need to find a system that works for us and we need to choose tools that align with our individual preferences and workflows.</p> <p>This show is also being posted to YouTube. When the video goes live, it will be posted on the blog post and show notes for this podcast episode.</p> <p>Show notes and full transcript: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e836\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e836</a>\u00a0</p> <p>Disclaimer: This post contains affiliate links for which I may receive compensation.
