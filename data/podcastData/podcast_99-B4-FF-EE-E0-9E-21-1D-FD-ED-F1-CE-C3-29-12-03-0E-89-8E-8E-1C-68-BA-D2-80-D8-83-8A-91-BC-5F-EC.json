    "Description": "<p>It has been over three decades since the statistical revolution overtook AI by a storm and over two &nbsp;decades since deep learning (DL) helped usher the latest resurgence of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the disappointing progress in conversational agents, NLU, and self-driving cars, has made it clear that progress has not lived up to the promise of these empirical and data-driven methods. DARPA has suggested that it is time for a third wave in AI, one that would be characterized by hybrid models \u2013 models that combine knowledge-based approaches with data-driven machine learning techniques.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Joining us on this panel discussion is polymath and linguist Walid Saba - Co-founder ONTOLOGIK.AI, Gadi Singer - VP &amp; Director, Cognitive Computing Research, Intel Labs and J. Mark Bishop - Professor of Cognitive Computing (Emeritus), Goldsmiths, University of London and Scientific Adviser to FACT360.</p>\n<p>Moderated by Dr. Keith Duggar and Dr. Tim Scarfe</p>\n<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/gadi-singer/</p>\n<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/walidsaba/</p>\n<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/profjmarkbishop/</p>\n<p>#machinelearning #artificialintelligence</p>\n",
