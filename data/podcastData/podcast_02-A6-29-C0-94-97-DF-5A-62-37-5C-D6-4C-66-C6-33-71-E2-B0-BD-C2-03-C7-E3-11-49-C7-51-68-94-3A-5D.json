    "Description": "<p>Stephen Ritz @<a href= \"http://www.twitter.com/StephenRitz\">StephenRitz</a> grows 50,000 pounds of vegetables in the Bronx. As founder of the Green Bronx Machine, his students grow plants while learning more and going onto college. Exciting! <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e131\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e131</a></p> <p>Today's sponsor is <a href= \"https://online.kidsdiscover.com/discover?utm_source=coolcatteacher&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=discovermap\"> Kid's Discover</a>. They're doing awesome things to drive inquiry based learning.

This fun, visual tool lets students explore 150 different science and social studies units for elementary and middle school learners. And while they can explore a wide variety of topics from the US Constitution to Ecology and Ancient China, I also like that you can assign these nonfiction texts and three different lexiles to supplement what you're doing in the classroom.
