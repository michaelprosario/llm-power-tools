    "Description": "<p>Sara Hooker is VP of Research at Cohere and leader of Cohere for AI. We discuss her recent paper critiquing the use of compute thresholds, measured in FLOPs (floating point operations), as an AI governance strategy. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We explore why this approach, recently adopted in both US and EU AI policies, may be problematic and oversimplified. Sara explains the limitations of using raw computational power as a measure of AI capability or risk, and discusses the complex relationship between compute, data, and model architecture.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Equally important, we go into Sara&#39;s work on &quot;The AI Language Gap.&quot; This research highlights the challenges and inequalities in developing AI systems that work across multiple languages. Sara discusses how current AI models, predominantly trained on English and a handful of high-resource languages, fail to serve the linguistic diversity of our global population. We explore the technical, ethical, and societal implications of this gap, and discuss potential solutions for creating more inclusive and representative AI systems.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We broadly discuss the relationship between language, culture, and AI capabilities, as well as the ethical considerations in AI development and deployment.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>YT Version: https://youtu.be/dBZp47999Ko</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>[00:00:00] Intro</p>\n<p>[00:02:12] FLOPS paper</p>\n<p>[00:26:42] Hardware lottery</p>\n<p>[00:30:22] The Language gap</p>\n<p>[00:33:25] Safety</p>\n<p>[00:38:31] Emergent</p>\n<p>[00:41:23] Creativity</p>\n<p>[00:43:40] Long tail</p>\n<p>[00:44:26] LLMs and society</p>\n<p>[00:45:36] Model bias</p>\n<p>[00:48:51] Language and capabilities</p>\n<p>[00:52:27] Ethical frameworks and RLHF</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sara Hooker</p>\n<p>https://www.sarahooker.me/</p>\n<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/sararosehooker/</p>\n<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2xy6h3sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</p>\n<p>https://x.com/sarahookr</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Interviewer: Tim Scarfe</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Refs</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The AI Language gap</p>\n<p>https://cohere.com/research/papers/the-AI-language-gap.pdf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>On the Limitations of Compute Thresholds as a Governance Strategy.</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05694v1</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Multilingual Alignment Prism: Aligning Global and Local Preferences to Reduce Harm</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18682</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Cohere Aya</p>\n<p>https://cohere.com/research/aya</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>RLHF Can Speak Many Languages: Unlocking Multilingual Preference Optimization for LLMs</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02552</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Back to Basics: Revisiting REINFORCE Style Optimization for Learning from Human Feedback in LLMs</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14740</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence</p>\n<p>https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>EU AI Act</p>\n<p>https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2024-0138_EN.pdf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The bitter lesson</p>\n<p>http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Neel Nanda interview</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ygf0GnlwmY</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet</p>\n<p>https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Chollet&#39;s ARC challenge</p>\n<p>https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Ryan Greenblatt on ARC</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9j3wB1RRGA</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is the third video from our Cohere partnership.
