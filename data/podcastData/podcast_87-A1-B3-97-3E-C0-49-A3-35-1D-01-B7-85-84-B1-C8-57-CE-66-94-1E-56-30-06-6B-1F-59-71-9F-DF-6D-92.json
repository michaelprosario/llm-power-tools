    "SourceUrl": "https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/",
    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.olin.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Olin College of Engineering</a> has one of the top-ranked undergrad engineering programs in the US. Its computing curriculum is a concentration within the engineering major, not a standalone major. The upshot is a liberal arts-informed course of study with fewer math and theory requirements than a typical CS degree and a greater emphasis on practical, job-ready skills like code quality, testing, and documentation. To learn more about how software design is taught at Olin, <a href=\"https://softdes.olin.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">explore the course</a>.</p><p>Andrew Mascillaro is a senior at Olin majoring in electrical and computer engineering. He\u2019s currently a software engineering intern at <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tableau</a>. You can find him on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-mascillaro\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.olin.edu/bios/steve-matsumoto\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Matsumoto</a> is an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Olin; his academic interests include crypto and cybersecurity.
