    "Description": "<p>Matt Spitz joins our latest podcast to discuss leading beyond domain expertise! As Head of Engineering @ Vanta, Matt shares his experience managing & developing a security program in the early days of Vanta before hiring for a specialized skillset. We also cover strategies on maximizing security at your organization as it grows, developing a company culture that invests in security, identifying when your org is ready to hire a domain expert, and how to effectively communicate with & lead domain experts within your org. In addition, Matt reveals what qualities he believes a security culture expert should possess & how eng leaders (who aren\u2019t domain experts in security) can help set the org\u2019s right technical direction.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattspitz/\"><strong>MATT SPITZ</strong></a></h2><p>Matt Spitz is the Head of Engineering at Trust Management Platform provider, Vanta, where he helps companies practice better security. Previously, he co-founded and led Dropbox's NYC office, started a company, and has built and scaled diverse engineering teams solving complex product and infrastructure challenges. He lives in San Francisco and rides his bike to work.</p><blockquote><p>\"The value that I can provide to all these departments is visibility and context. The perfect strategy for support or something like security doesn't exist. It's contextual, right? And the things that we are trying to do as a business, the things that are happening outside of those departments that maybe I have visibility into, that is value that I can provide to those people in shifting their strategy and setting the right strategy that's contextually appropriate.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Matt Spitz \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Join us at ELC Annual 2023!</h2><p>ELC Annual is our flagship conference for engineering leaders.
