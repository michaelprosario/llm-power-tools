    "Description": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Here's a breakdown of what we cover:</span></p><p><ul></p><p>\u00a0<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cloud IDEs will mature as <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/this-week-in-programming-github-codespaces-portable-dev-environment/\">GitHub's Codespaces</a> platform gains acceptance through its integration into the GitHub service. Other factors include new startups in the space, such as</span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.gitpod.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0GitPod</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which offers a secure, cloud-based IDE, and\u00a0</span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.uptycs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uptycs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which uses telemetry data to lock-down developer environments. \"So I think you'll, you're just gonna see more people exposed to it, and they're gonna be like, 'holy crap, this makes my life a lot easier '.\"</span></li></p><p>\u00a0<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">FinOps reflects the more stringent views on managing costs, focusing on the efficiency of resources that a company provides for developers. The focus also translates to the GreenOps movement with its emphasis on efficiency.</span></li></p><p>\u00a0<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Software bill of materials (SBOMs) will continue to mature with Sigstore as the project with the fastest expected adoption. Witness, from\u00a0</span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.testifysec.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Telemetry Project</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, is another project. The SPDX community has been at the center of the movement for over a decade now before people cared about it.\u00a0</span></li></p><p>\u00a0<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/i-need-to-talk-to-you-about-kubernetes-gitops/\">GitOps</a> and <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/opentelemetry-properly-explained-and-demoed/\">Open Telemetry</a>: This year, KubeCon submissions topics on GitOps were super high. OpenTelemetry is the second most popular project in the CNCF, behind Kubernetes.</span></li></p><p>\u00a0<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Platform engineering is hot. Anisczyk cites <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/spotifys-backstage-a-strategic-guide/\">Backstage</a>, a CNCF project, as one he is watching. It has a healthy plugin extension ecosystem and a corresponding large community. People make fun of Jenkins, but Jenkins is likely going to be around as long as Linux because of the plugin community. Backstage is going along that same route.</span></li></p><p>\u00a0<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/webassembly-to-let-developers-combine-languages/\">WebAssembly</a>: \"You will probably see an uptick in edge cases, like smaller deployments as opposed to full-blown cloud-based workloads. Web Assembly will mix with containers and VMs. \"It's just the way that software works.\"</span></li></p><p>\u00a0<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kubernetes is part of today's distributed fabric. Linux is now everywhere. Kubernetes is going through the same evolution. Kubernetes is going into airplanes, cars, and fast-food restaurants. \"People are going to focus on the layers up top, not necessarily like, the core Kubernetes project itself. It's going to be all the cool stuff built on top.\"</span></li></p><p></ul></p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
