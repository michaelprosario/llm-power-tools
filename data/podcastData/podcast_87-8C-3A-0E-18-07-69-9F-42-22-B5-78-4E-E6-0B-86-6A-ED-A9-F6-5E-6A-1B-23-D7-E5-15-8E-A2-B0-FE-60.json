    "Description": "<p>Tom Loud dropped out of high school because he didn\u2019t connect with his teachers. Somehow, he connected with books though and became a high school and college graduate. Now, Tom is a 10-year classroom veteran who is working to make his classroom (and help others) connect with kids in new ways. Today we\u2019ll talk about unleashing the potential in every child. And yes, you\u2019ll hear birds chirping, but that is ok!</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e509\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e509</a></p> Urkund: Today\u2019s Sponsor <a href= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.urkund.com/prevent-plagiarism/?utm_source%3Dcoolcat%26utm_medium%3Dpodcast%26utm_campaign%3D2019-06-us-&sa=D&ust=1559568224072000&usg=AFQjCNF3s6qz_8yqqGu-bTdb6cvwdRNz4Q\"> Urkund</a>\u00a0is great as a plagiarism prevention tool and connects with most common Learning Management Systems like Google Classroom, Moodle, and Canvas or as a stand-alone web tool or by email.
