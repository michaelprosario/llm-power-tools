    "Description": "<p>Richard and Greg talk to Kevin Royalty about Home Server. Intended for the home, Microsoft's Home Server works great for small businesses with ten or less workstations, providing shared file services, an awesome backup solution and even remote access! Home Server offers a starting point before Small Business Server, but even after you've moved to SBS, you'll want to keep using Home Server for backup.</p>\n",
