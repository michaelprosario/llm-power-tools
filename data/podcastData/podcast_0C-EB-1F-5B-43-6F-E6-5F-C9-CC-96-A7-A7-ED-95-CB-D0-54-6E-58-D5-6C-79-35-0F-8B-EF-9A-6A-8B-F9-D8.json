I then taught English in Plano ISD and earned my Master's degree in English from SMU. I was voted Dowell Campus Teacher of the Year in 2011 by my peers and served as a campus leader in various roles, including 504 and RTI Coordinator.  My transition into the field of counseling was fueled by my passion for advocating for and building relationships with students. I have a special interest in biblio counseling because I love harnessing the power of literature and its insight into the human experience. Well-written books help increase students\u2019 self-awareness and self-esteem, build empathy, and aid in students' ability to face developmental crises.  I am joining the Bennett family after serving Faubion Middle School as a school counselor for the last year and a half. At Faubion, I was able to make a positive impact and help remove barriers to students\u2019 academic success.  My mission is to provide a proactive, comprehensive, and developmentally appropriate program so that students leave Bennett ready to launch into their individual journeys to become successful, productive citizens and lifelong learners in a diverse and changing world.  My husband, Julius, and I are the proud parents of two: Samantha (22) - a Davidson College '19 graduate and Jay (16) - a sophomore at McKinney Boyd High School.</p> <p>Blog: <a href= \"https://mrsthompsonliveskind.weebly.com/about-me.html\">https://mrsthompsonliveskind.weebly.com/about-me.html</a></p> <p>Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/thompsliveskind\">https://twitter.com/thompsliveskind</a></p>  Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
