    "Title": "Decompiling Dreams: A New Approach to ARC? - Alessandro Palmarini",
    "SourceUrl": "https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/machinelearningstreettalk/episodes/Decompiling-Dreams-A-New-Approach-to-ARC----Alessandro-Palmarini-e2psmmi",
    "Description": "<p>Alessandro Palmarini is a post-baccalaureate researcher at the Santa Fe Institute working under the supervision of Melanie Mitchell. He completed his undergraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. Palmarini's current research focuses on developing AI systems that can efficiently acquire new skills from limited data, inspired by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet's work on measuring intelligence. His work builds upon the DreamCoder program synthesis system, introducing a novel approach called \"dream decompiling\" to improve library learning in inductive program synthesis. Palmarini is particularly interested in addressing the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge, aiming to create AI systems that can perform abstract reasoning tasks more efficiently than current approaches. His research explores the balance between computational efficiency and data efficiency in AI learning processes.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>DO YOU WANT WORK ON ARC with the MindsAI team (current ARC winners)?\nMLST is sponsored by Tufa Labs:\nFocus: ARC, LLMs, test-time-compute, active inference, system2 reasoning, and more.\nFuture plans: Expanding to complex environments like Warcraft 2 and Starcraft 2.\nInterested?
