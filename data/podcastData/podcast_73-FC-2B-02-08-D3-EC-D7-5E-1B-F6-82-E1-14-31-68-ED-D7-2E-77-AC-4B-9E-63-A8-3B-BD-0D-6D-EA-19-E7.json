    "Description": "<p>Building growth & mobile eng teams from the ground up is never easy \u2013 but the right frameworks, guardrails, & strategic conversations will set your org up for success! We cover the intersection of growth & mobile engineering with Atish Das Sarma (Head of Growth Engineering @ Patreon ) & Shannon Ma (Director of Engineering, Mobile @ Patreon) discussing how to balance short & long-term growth demands, strategically aligning new features & growth, and what it\u2019s like making the transition into an established company with room for impact!</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/atish-das-sarma-8a61845/\"><strong>ATISH DAS SARMA</strong></a></h2><p>Atish (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/atishdassarma\">@atishdassarma</a>) leads the Growth Engineering team at Patreon. The Growth team at Patreon is responsible for holistically improving the product surface to help creators build and grow their businesses. Specific areas of focus include working across the full funnel to drive member acquisition, member retention, and creator acquisition.</p><p>Previously, Atish led iCloud subscriptions growth initiatives which is part of the broader Services organization at Apple. In addition to accelerating revenue growth for iCloud, Atish was also responsible for various data and ML initiatives across Cloud Services. He also held roles at Twitter and Google. Atish is passionate about working in areas with a broad opportunity & scope from the early stages, defining long-lasting themes, and building the corresponding teams to execute on them. He particularly enjoys leading organizations that are directly accountable for key business outcomes.</p><blockquote><p>\"For growth, you need to sort of think holistically in Patreon\u2019s world, both from creators\u2019 and potential members\u2019 side and truly understand what is perhaps preventing some creators from getting started. So how do you sort of think about that holistically and then start building solutions that will empower them longer term.\u201d</p><p>- Atish Das Sarma \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannonmma/?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAABaAGMBeXYpcofvdhFg-iMsXEaHb999gSU\"><strong>SHANNON MA</strong></a></h2><p>Shannon (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/shannonma\">@shannonma</a>) is the Director of Engineering for Mobile at Patreon. Shannon and the entire team are diving in to create a world-class mobile experience built to best serve creators, so they can showcase what they do best. He previously supported consumer product teams at Instagram and Facebook for nine years. Prior to this, he got started in mobile at Apple helping build iOS.</p><blockquote><p>\"Our goal as a company is to be the best memberships product for creator. Our hypothesis about how we can get there is by really kind of like coupling content around community. In order for us to do this really well, the community almost has to feel like it's part of the content, like it helps kind of like elevate the content.</p><p>- Shannon Ma \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Our in-person conference <a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">ELC Annual</a> returns 10/27-28!</strong></h2><p>Learn from 60+ of the best engineering leaders in the industry / Critical insights on leadership, career and technology / Plus tons of experiences optimized for deep conversations & meaningful connections - all to help you build your support network!</p><p><strong><i>Don't miss out on being part of the biggest celebration of engineering leadership of the year!</i></strong></p><h3>Grab your ticket HERE: <strong><a href=\"https://hubs.la/Q01mc6qD0\">sfelc.com/annual2022</a></strong></h3><hr /><h2>Check out our friends at <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\">Shortcut</a>!</h2><p><a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>Shortcut</strong></a> is an issue tracker that offers all the functionality, without most of the complexity making it easier for you to plan, collaborate, build, and measure success.</p><p><i><strong>Right now, listeners of our show can get 2-months free on any paid plan.</strong></i></p><h3><strong>Learn more & sign up at</strong> <a href=\"http://shortcut.com/elc\"><strong>shortcut.com/elc</strong></a></h3><h2><strong>SHOW NOTES:</strong></h2><ul><li>Patreon\u2019s major strategic transformation (2:30)</li><li>The role mobile plays in Patreon\u2019s vision (5:27)</li><li>Integrating a growth strategy holistically throughout your product (6:11)</li><li>What it\u2019s like transitioning into an already well-established company (7:48)</li><li>Defining a framework for an early-growth organization (11:41)</li><li>Guardrails to balance short-term and long-term growth demands (14:16)</li><li>Habits & rituals to inspire strategy-focused conversations in your team (18:00)</li><li>Shannon\u2019s decision-making process \u2013 and why the focus is on mobile (19:22)</li><li>The intersection of growth and mobile engineering (22:07)</li><li>Why being a \u201cruthless\u201d prioritizer is key (24:28)</li><li>Prioritization conversations between mobile and engineering (27:05)</li><li>A sneak-peek into Patreon\u2019s next big bets (28:32)</li><li>The implications of new features on growth engineering (32:07)</li><li>Start with targeting your high-intent users (34:08)</li><li>Rapid-Fire Questions (35:05)</li></ul>\n",
