    "Description": "\n        <p>During its formative years in the late 1990's, Paypal attracted an extraordinary group of young entrepreneurs, who then went on to build some of the best known companies in tech.&nbsp;They became known as The PayPal Mafia\u2014and Max Levchin was one of the leaders.&nbsp;A computer genius from Soviet Ukraine, Max joined Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman and&nbsp;others as they grew PayPal into a massively successful online payment service.&nbsp;Along the way, they encountered almost every start-up challenge imaginable, including the emotional ouster of Elon Musk as CEO.&nbsp;After PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, Max couldn't sit still, so he launched a startup lab that eventually led to another successful fintech company: Affirm. Guy will talk to Max about Affirm next week, in the second episode of this two-part series.&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
