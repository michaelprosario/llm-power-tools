    "Description": "<p>We dissect one of the biggest challenges that eng leaders face in their day-to-day \u2013 navigating the balance between going deep in technical work & maintaining a high-level view of business strategy. Oded Kedem, Chief Technology Officer @ BigPanda, shares examples from his experience, covering strategies for prioritizing where to go deep into the technology, bringing technical expertise to the executive team, bridging the gap between marketing & technology, and aligning customer expectations with a product\u2019s actual capabilities. Oded also shares frameworks for prioritization conversations, valuable questions to pose during executive decision-making conversations, and approaches to changing past technical decisions.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/odedkedem/?originalSubdomain=il\"><strong>ODED KEDEM</strong></a></h2><p>Oded Kedem, Chief Technology Officer at BigPanda, brings a wealth of experience in software from ground-up development to managing engineering teams and was also the founder of Zerto, a Cloud BC/DR company. Throughout his many years in the industry, Oded has developed a deep understanding of AIOps and the needs of customers. He recognizes that we are just scratching the surface with AI and automation.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAs companies evolve, people change roles and the technology changes, the requirements change. We chose in the past, the product does it in method A. Let's ask, 'Okay, why did we choose A in the first place?' And once in a while, someone from engineering came up and said, 'Yeah, I have a great idea. Let's do B.' And I would always send them, 'Okay, go back to the documentation, because if you thought this through and you think that making these changes is worth our while and the risk and the instability it may bring, let's go, let's do it.'\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Oded Kedem \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>We\u2019re less than one week away from <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/glow/?utm_source=elc&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=glow-2024-promo&utm_content=text&utm_term=register\">GLOW 2024</a></h3><p>Attend GLOW 2024 - <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/\">Jellyfish\u2019s</a> virtual summit for engineering, product, and finance leaders who are looking to deliver greater business impact while building great software and teams.
