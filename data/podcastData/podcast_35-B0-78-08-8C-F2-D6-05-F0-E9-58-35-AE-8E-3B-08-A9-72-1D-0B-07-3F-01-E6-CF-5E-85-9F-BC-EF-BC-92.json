As Richard McManus\u00a0<a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/coding-sucks-anyway-matt-welsh-on-the-end-of-programming/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on The New Stack</a>, Welsh is a former professor of computer science at Harvard who spoke at a virtual meetup of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chicagoacm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Association for Computing Machinery</a> (ACM), explaining his thesis that ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot represent the beginning of the end of programming.</p><p>Welsh joined us on The New Stack Makers to discuss his perspectives about the end of programming and answer questions about the future of computer science, distributed computing, and more.</p><p>Welsh is now the founder of <a href=\"https://www.fixie.ai/\">fixie.ai</a>, a platform they are building to let companies develop applications on top of large language models to extend with different capabilities.</p><p>For 40 to 50 years, programming language design has had one goal.
