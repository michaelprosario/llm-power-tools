    "Description": "<p>The mathematics curriculum of today was created before computers. Conrad Wolfram has written a book, <a href= \"https://amzn.to/3dqJOBI\">The Math(s) Fix</a> and how AI can be part of this process of learning new math. He says we're \"making humans into third rate calculators instead of helping humans be problem solvers.\" He also argues that math should be approachable for everyone and we spend too much time in schools on the wrong tasks. We even talk about some of the charts and numbers shared during the covid19 health crisis and the need for critical thinking in every area of society.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e680\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e680</a></p> <p><em>Sponsor: Welcome TGR Foundation and Discovery Education as a sponsor to my podcast. For nearly 25 years, the TGR Foundation, a Tiger Woods Charity, visualized a world where opportunity is universal and potential is limitless. Their mission is to empower students to pursue their passions through education - instilling in them the strength and skills to persevere and define their own path. Their award-winning curricula has already reached more than one million students.\u00a0</em></p> <p><em>Now in the age of COVID-19 the TGR Foundation and Discovery Education introduce the first module in a new series of no-cost digital professional learning resources, empowering educators with new strategies to support student success far beyond school campuses. The PD series provides every educator, especially those from under-resourced communities, the access and materials needed to transform teaching during COVID-19 and beyond.

Working with start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, it spans industries as diverse as medicine, finance and telecoms.</p> <p>Conrad is recognised as a thought leader in AI, data science and computation, pioneering a Multi-Paradigm data science approach.</p> <p>Conrad is also a leading advocate for a fundamental shift of maths education to become computer-based or alternatively introduce a new core subject of computational thinking. He founded computerbasedmath.org and computationalthinking.org to fundamentally fix maths education for the AI age - rebuilding the curriculum assuming computers exist. The movement is now a worldwide force in re-engineering the STEM curriculum. His groundbreaking book 'The Math(s) Fix - an education blueprint for the AI age' www.themathsfix.org is released on 10th June.</p> <p>Conrad regularly appears in the media to talk about subjects ranging from decisions and data science to 21st-century education. He attended Eton College and holds degrees in Natural Sciences and Maths from the University of Cambridge.</p> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a sponsored podcast episode.
