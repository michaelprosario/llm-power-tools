It is trademarked as Step-by-Step Writing Program. I am now launching a professional development training on how to teach writing for Grades 3-5. It is called Reluctant Writers to Rockstar Writers. It takes teachers through the writing process, sentence structure, paragraph writing, narrative writing, opinion writing, informative writing, revising, editing, and progress monitoring. I offer a free webinar for teachers on writing strategies and my secret to writing success. Here is a link that will take your audience to the webinar, special offers for the writing course, and for a freebie: \u00a0\u00a0<a href= \"https://rockinresources.com/coolcat\">\u00a0https://rockinresources.com/coolcat</a></em></p>",
