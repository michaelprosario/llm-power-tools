    "Description": "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) experiments can open up discussion of the human aspect of training algorithms and help them improve. In this podcast episode, Roberta Freitas shares AI Experiments that any teacher can use with students. Additionally, we discuss the morals and ethics of Artificial intelligence and the responsibility of users to report issues of bias and concerns with\u00a0 AI and algorithms. Additionally, we discuss the practical needs of humans to be able to break out of the algorithms that can keep them chained to past behavior.</p> <p>Show Notes, Resources & Transcripts: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e790\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e790</a></p> <p>Sponsor - Free Educator Wellness Toolkit:Educator wellness is now more important than ever.
