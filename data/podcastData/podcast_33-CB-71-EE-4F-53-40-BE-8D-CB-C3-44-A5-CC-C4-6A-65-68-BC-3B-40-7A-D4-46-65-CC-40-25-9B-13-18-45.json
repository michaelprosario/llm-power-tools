    "Description": "Nicole Biscotti had children, and she was a teacher. She thought she understood everything about children. That was until her fourth son, Jason, was born. As Jason grew, Nicole knew he was different. Nicole shares how eventually she discovered Jason had ADHD and how she changed her high school classroom to reach all of the children. Kids with ADHD are different and need accommodations, but it can be challenging for already stressed teachers to figure out how to reach every child. Nicole shares her solution and some surprising things she learned as she has helped Jason grow and succeed in the classroom and at home. This show is a must-listen episode for parents of kids with ADHD and the teachers working to reach these precious children. <p>Show Transcript: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e778\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e778</a></p> <p>Advancement Courses:\u00a0Show sponsor <a href= \"https://www.advancementcourses.com/?utm_source=coolcatteacher&utm_medium=influencer&tid=4220202&utm_campaign=2022partnership&utm_content=podcast_aprilepisodes\"> Advancement Courses</a> is who I chose for my professional development.
