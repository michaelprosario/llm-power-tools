    "Description": "We're hard at work planning our next live show, so we bring you this favorite from the last year: Kate Spade. A 1991 conversation at a Mexican restaurant led Kate & Andy Spade to ask, \"What's missing in designer handbags?\" Kate's answer was a simple modern-shaped handbag that launched the iconic fashion brand. PLUS for our postscript \"How You Built That\", we check back with Dennis Darnell and his line of garbage can fly traps.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
