    "Description": "<p>Dr. Guy Emerson is a computational linguist and obtained<strong> </strong>his Ph.D from Cambridge university where he is now a research fellow and lecturer. On panel we also have myself, Dr. Tim Scarfe, as well as Dr. Keith Duggar and the veritable Dr. Walid Saba. We dive into distributional semantics, probability theory, fuzzy logic, grounding, vagueness and the grammar/cognition connection.</p>\n<p>The aim of distributional semantics is to design computational techniques that can automatically learn the meanings of words from a body of text. The twin challenges are: how do we represent meaning, and how do we learn these representations? We want to learn the meanings of words from a corpus by exploiting the fact that the context of a word tells us something about its meaning. This is known as the distributional hypothesis. In his Ph.D thesis, Dr. Guy Emerson presented a distributional model which can learn truth-conditional semantics which are grounded by objects in the real world.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the show!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-guy-emerson\">https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-guy-emerson</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/284882?show=full\">https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/284882?show=full</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computational-linguistics-and-grammar-engineering-Bender-Emerson/bbd6f3b92a0f1ea8212f383cc4719bfe86b3588c\">https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computational-linguistics-and-grammar-engineering-Bender-Emerson/bbd6f3b92a0f1ea8212f383cc4719bfe86b3588c</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mlst</p>\n",
