    "Description": "\n        <p>Tory Burch didn\u2019t set out to make her name into a brand; she didn\u2019t even set out to get into fashion. As a matter of fact, she sort of gave up any fashion ambitions when her first designs were rejected by Ralph Lauren. But after noticing there were plenty luxury brands and plenty of affordable brands but nothing in between, Tory began to see a gap that she could fill. She tried to revive a dormant brand from the 1960\u2019s, until one phone call put an end to that idea. So in 2004, with the help of her husband\u2014a fashion entrepreneur in his own right\u2014Tory Burch launched Tory Burch, a lifestyle brand with everything from shoes and swimwear, to handbags and home goods. Despite a rift in the relationship with her husband, that also bled over into the business, Tory has built a global brand with over 300 stores worldwide.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
