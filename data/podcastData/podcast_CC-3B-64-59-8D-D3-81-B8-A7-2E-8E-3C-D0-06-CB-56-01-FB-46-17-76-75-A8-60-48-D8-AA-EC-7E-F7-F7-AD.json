    "Description": "\n        <p>After PayPal sold to eBay in 2002, Max Levchin could have relaxed on a beach for the rest of his life.&nbsp;But that\u2019s not the kind of person he is. He isn\u2019t happy unless he\u2019s coming up with new ideas and building companies \u2013 so much so that he actually fell into a dark place after leaving PayPal.&nbsp;He didn\u2019t fully find himself until years later, when he rediscovered his passion for the \u201chard, valuable, fun\u201d problems of fintech. Now, Max runs another billion-dollar company: Affirm, a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service that\u2019s transforming how we purchase things on credit. This is the second part of a two-part conversation with Max; to hear the story of PayPal, be sure to listen to part 1!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>\n      ",
