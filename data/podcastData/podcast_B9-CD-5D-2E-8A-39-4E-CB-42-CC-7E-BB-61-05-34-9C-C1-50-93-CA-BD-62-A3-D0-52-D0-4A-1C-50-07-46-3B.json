Their notes on how to travel on a shoestring became a book, which grew into Lonely Planet \u2014 the largest travel guide publisher in the world. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how 15-year-old Michael Mendicino, with help from his mom, took a teenage trend and turned it into a board game called Bottle Flip.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
