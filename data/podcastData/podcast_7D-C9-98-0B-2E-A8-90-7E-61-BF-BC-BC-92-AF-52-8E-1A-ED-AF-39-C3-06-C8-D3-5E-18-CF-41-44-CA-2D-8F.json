Everyone's doing whatever they want to do to a degree. How do you convince these 30 different directors or whatever that we do have common objectives? We do have some things in common. There are places where we can collaborate. There are places where we can have sort of economies of scale if we pool all of our resources together and we can all benefit from these things.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Pete Peterson \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>We\u2019re hosting the first ELC Annual Watch Party on 11/8!</h2><p>We\u2019re livestreaming the most popular sessions from the ELC Annual 2023 conference + hosting virtual roundtable discussions to connect you with eng leaders around the globe AND in your city.</p><p>Our first topic covers Generative AI & engineering leadership with Wade Chambers\u2026 no this isn\u2019t about the tech - it\u2019s about the leadership skills and competencies you need to evolve and adapt to lead in this next generation!</p><h3><i><strong>We have different events for Europe, East Coast & West Coast!
