    "Description": "\n        <p>Millions of Americans don\u2019t have enough to eat \u2014 a startling fact considering 40% of the food produced in the U.S. gets thrown away. And a lot of that food\u2026 from restaurants, supermarkets, office buildings and more\u2026 is perfectly safe to eat. What\u2019s worse is that this discarded food waste produces harmful methane emissions that contribute to global climate change.</p><p>Jasmine Crowe-Houston is an entrepreneur who became obsessed with these problems. In 2017, she founded Goodr, which works with businesses to take unused food and deliver it to those who need it. Instead of paying waste management companies to throw surplus food into landfills, businesses can work with Goodr to deliver that food to local nonprofits that get it to people in need.&nbsp;</p><p>This week on How I Built This Lab<em>, </em>Jasmine talks with Guy about solving the logistical challenge of delivering surplus food to people experiencing food insecurity. Plus, the two discuss Jasmine\u2019s decision to launch Goodr as a for-profit organization, and the growing corporate focus on sustainability that\u2019s led to Goodr\u2019s rapid growth.</p><p>This episode was produced by Katherine Sypher and edited by John Isabella, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
