    "Description": "<p>Lakshmi Baskaran shares insights on impromptu communication, why it\u2019s important, and a framework for successfully navigating these tricky situations! We also cover team topology and why it\u2019s so important to have the right composition of product-minded vs. technical-minded engineers within any eng team. Lakshmi shares how prioritizing team topology will impact hiring, influence engineering culture, and aid in eng team reorgs / restructures. She also discusses what the future of AI looks like for executive eng leaders & what to consider when adopting AI practices / technologies. And to bring it all together, we dissect how Lakshmi\u2019s Triple-A impromptu communication framework operates in the context of both team topology & AI adoption.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshmibaskaran/\"><strong>LAKSHMI BASKARAN</strong></a></h2><p>Lakshmi Baskaran is an accomplished business leader, entrepreneur, and an angel investor with over two decades of experience in the tech industry.

As an engineering leader, you want to spice up that message with how it is interesting to your customers. The framework that I use in scenarios like this is called 'What If And So That' framework. If you're running an email platform, what if you're able to search through millions of emails in a sub millisecond so that your users can have faster search abilities compared to our competitors? Build a dream scenario and tell them how the technology can help them meet their dream scenario.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Lakshmi Baskaran \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h3>We\u2019re less than one week away from <a href=\"http://jellyfish.co/glow\">GLOW 2024</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://jellyfish.co/\">Jellyfish\u2019s</a> virtual summit for engineering, product, and finance leaders who are looking to deliver greater business impact while building great software and teams.
