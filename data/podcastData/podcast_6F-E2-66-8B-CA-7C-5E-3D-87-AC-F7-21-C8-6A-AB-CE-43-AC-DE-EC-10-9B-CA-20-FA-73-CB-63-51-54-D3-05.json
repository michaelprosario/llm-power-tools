    "Description": "<p>Digital.ai, an AI-powered DevSecOps platform, serves large enterprises such as financial institutions, insurance companies, and gaming firms. The primary challenge faced by these clients is scaling their DevOps practices across vast organizations. They aim to combine modern development methodologies like agile DevOps with the need for speed and intimacy with end-users on a large scale.</p><p>This episode features a discussion between Wing To of Digital.ai and TNS host Heather Joslyn about platform engineering and the role of AI in enhancing automation. It delves into the dilemma of whether increased code production and release frequency driven by DevOps practices are inherently beneficial. Additionally, it explores the emerging challenge of AI-assisted development and how large enterprises are striving to realize productivity gains across their organizations.</p><p>Digital.ai is focused on incorporating AI into automation to assist developers in creating and delivering code while helping organizations derive more business value from their software in production. The company employs templates to capture and replicate key aspects of software delivery processes and uses AI to automate the rapid setup of developer environments and tooling. These efforts contribute to the concept of the internal developer platform, which consists of multiple toolsets for tasks like creating pipelines and setting up various components.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about Platform Engineering, DevSecOps and Digital.ai:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/\">Platform Engineering Overview, News, and Trends</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/sre-vs-devops-vs-platform-engineering/\">SRE vs. DevOps vs. Platform Engineering</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/meet-the-new-devsecops/\">Meet the New DevSecOps</a></p>\n",
