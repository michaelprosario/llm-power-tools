Enrico is a key leader in process improvement and internal communications. His passion for strategic decision-making, creative problem solving, and empathy shines through as he discusses his personal growth and the influences that have shaped his leadership style. </p>\n<p>Enrico delves into his belief in servant leadership, with Isabella sharing more about this leadership model from the teachings of Robert K. Greenleaf, a thought leader in Servant Leadership. He also highlights the importance of empathy, crediting his wife (shout out to her) for helping him grow into a more compassionate leader.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The conversation then shifts to the future, where Enrico explores the evolving landscape of healthcare and technology, particularly the role of AI, augmented reality, and virtual reality.
