    "Description": "<p>Along with his work at Stanford, Katanforoosh is a founding member of deeplearning.ai and co-created the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.\u00a0</p><p>He believes the rapidly expanding capabilities of AI will mean that humans, and especially programmers, will need to learn new skills faster than ever. This doesn't mean machines are going to take our jobs. Rather, with the assistance of AI, humans will become far more capable, learning faster and mastering more domains.\u00a0</p><p>Not surprisingly, Katanforoosh has built his business with the goal of addressing this issue. Workera aims to help companies identify where their employees lack skills and provide them with personalized instruction that can quickly bring them up to the next level.</p><p>You can find Kian on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kiankatan?lang=en\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiankatan/\">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=\"https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/instructor/kiank\">Stanford's website</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks to Stack Overflow user PaxDiablo, who was awarded a Life Boat badge for providing a great answer to the question: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29375785/first-month-of-quarter-given-month-in-python/29381448#29381448\">Given \u00a0a month in numeric form, how do you find the first month of its respective quarter?\u00a0</a></p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
