    "Description": "<p>Just as everyone was heading out to the New Year's holidays last year, CTO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robzuber/\">Rob Zuber</a> got a surprise of a most unwelcome sort. A customer alerted CircleCI to suspicious GitHub OAuth activity. Although the scope of the attack appeared limited, there was still no telling if other customers of the DevOps-friendly continuous integration and continuous delivery platform were impacted.</p><p>This notification kicked off a deeper review by CircleCI\u2019s security team with GitHub, and they rotated all GitHub OAuth tokens on behalf of their customers. On January 4, the company also made the difficult but necessary decision to alert customers of this \u201csecurity instance,\u201d asking them to <a href=\"https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/\">immediately rotate any and all stored secrets</a> and review internal logs for any unauthorized access.</p><p>In this latest episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, we discuss with Zuber the attack and how CircleCI responded. We also talk about what other companies should do to avoid the same situation, and what to do should it happen again.</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
