    "Description": "<p><p>In this episode of The New Stack\u2019s On the Road show at Open Source Summit in Austin, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/myonk/\">Matt Yonkovit</a>, Head of Open Source at <a href=\"https://www.percona.com\">Percona</a>, shared his thoughts on how economic uncertainty could affect the open source ecosystem. <br /><br />Open source, of course, is free. So what role does the economic play in whether or not open source software is contributed to, downloaded and used in production? \u201cGenerally, open source is considered a bit recession proof,\u201d Yonkovit said. But that doesn\u2019t mean that things won\u2019t change. Over the past several years, the number of open source companies has increased dramatically, and the amount of funding sloshing around in the ecosystem has been huge. That might change. <br /><br />And if the funding situation does change? \u201cI think the big differentiator for a lot of people in the open source space is going to be the communities,\u201d Yonkovit said. When we talk about having \u2018backing,\u2019 it\u2019s usually in reference to financial investors, but in open source the backing of a community is just as important. In the absence of deep pockets, a community of people who believe in the project can help it survive \u2014 and show that the idea is really solid. <br /><br />If you look back at the history of open source, Yonkovit said, it\u2019s about people having an idea that inspires other people to contribute to make it a reality. Sometimes those ideas aren\u2019t commercially viable, even in the best of times \u2014 even if they do get widespread adoption. The only thing that\u2019s changing now is that financial investors are going to be a bit more picky in making sure the projects they fund aren\u2019t just inspirational ideas, but also are commercially viable.</p></p>\n",
