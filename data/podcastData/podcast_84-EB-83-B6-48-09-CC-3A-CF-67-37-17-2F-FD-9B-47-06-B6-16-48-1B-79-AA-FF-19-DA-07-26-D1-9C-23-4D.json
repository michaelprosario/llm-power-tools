Make books, send the link to parents and even include audio and video. As a teacher, you can get started with a library of 40 books as part of their free version - go to <a href=\"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/bookcreator\">coolcatteacher.com/bookcreator</a> to get started now. This is great news! Now we can all use Book Creator in our classrooms, on any device, using the Chrome web browser. <em>(This tool would be perfect for following the techniques described in today's show.)</em></p>",
