    "Description": "<p>Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention in machine learning, but the reasons for their existence and pervasiveness remain unclear. there's good reason to believe neural networks look at very different features than we would have expected. &nbsp;As articulated in the 2019 \"features not bugs\" paper Adversarial examples can be directly attributed to the presence of non-robust features: features derived from patterns in the data distribution that are highly predictive, yet brittle and incomprehensible to humans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Adversarial examples don't just affect deep learning models. A cottage industry has sprung up around Threat Modeling in AI and ML Systems and their dependencies.
