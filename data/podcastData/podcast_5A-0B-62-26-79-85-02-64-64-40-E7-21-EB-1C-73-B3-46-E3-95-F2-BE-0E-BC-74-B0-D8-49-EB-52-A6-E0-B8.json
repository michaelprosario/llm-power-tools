    "Description": "<p>Denise Musselwhite is the founder of Tech and Thrive. She is a dynamic person that is memorable. We have been connected through a number of Women\u2019s groups that focus on technology. One of the words she shared to describe herself is Deliberate, and the definition of this word means to carefully think or talk something through. Slow and measured, the pace of this kind of careful decision making. As the daughter of immigrants to the US she learned to move through life with a heavy focus on her serving her clients. She believes this\u00a0 is essential for success for her clients as well as her own business.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She grew up in an entrepreneurial family that focused on service. She helped her family by translating technical writing into Spanish for her parents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When thinking through what she wanted her career to be, she knew it would be in technology.\u00a0 She was the first gen in her family to attend college and started with Valencia College when it was a 2-year college.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a woman in technology and working her way to\u00a0become a Chief Information Officer, she represents less than 2% of the workforce as a Latina woman in the tech world. She started her own business because she grew up watching her family be entrepreneurs. She went back to get her masters degree when she turned 45 and focused her master\u2019s thesis on the barriers that hold women back in their careers. Before COVID, she discovered that stem careers focused more on men rather than women. Women are still not represented in technology leadership roles. Only 26% are leaders in the tech world. Less than 3% Latinas make it to the top of the tech leadership.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When asked what is the best mentoring advice you want to share with our listeners? Her response was that in order for you to accelerate your own growth and development you have to understand who you are and decide who you are. If you allow someone to decide who you are for you. One needs to understand what you need and a strategy with a plan of action to move towards your strengths</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
