Her passion for the advancement of women in games and tech reaches beyond Riot, and she has been honored by groups such as Girls Inc. and Wonder Women Tech.</p><blockquote><p>\"If you're asking, 'How can I get ahead?', I'm here to tell you also that you gotta flip that. That's exactly the wrong question to ask because the more you ask questions like this, the more people will perceive you as self-serving. There is no quicker way to lose somebody's trust than for them to believe you are acting in your best interests and not in theirs, not in your company's, not in your customer's. Focusing on your customer, focusing on your manager's needs, on your company's needs, on your team needs is a much more effective way to move forward.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Oksana Kubushyna \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>Join us at ELC Annual 2023!</h2><p>ELC Annual is our flagship conference for engineering leaders.
