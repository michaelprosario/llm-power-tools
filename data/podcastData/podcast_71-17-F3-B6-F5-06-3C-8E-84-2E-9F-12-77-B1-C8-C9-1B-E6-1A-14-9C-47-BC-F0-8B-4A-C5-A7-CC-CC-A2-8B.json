    "Description": "<p>Saurabh Baji discusses Cohere&#39;s approach to developing and deploying large language models (LLMs) for enterprise use. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>* Cohere focuses on pragmatic, efficient models tailored for business applications rather than pursuing the largest possible models.</p>\n<p>* They offer flexible deployment options, from cloud services to on-premises installations, to meet diverse enterprise needs.</p>\n<p>* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highlighted as a critical capability, allowing models to leverage enterprise data securely.</p>\n<p>* Cohere emphasizes model customization, fine-tuning, and tools like reranking to optimize performance for specific use cases.</p>\n<p>* The company has seen significant growth, transitioning from developer-focused to enterprise-oriented services.</p>\n<p>* Major customers like Oracle, Fujitsu, and TD Bank are using Cohere&#39;s models across various applications, from HR to finance.</p>\n<p>* Baji predicts a surge in enterprise AI adoption over the next 12-18 months as more companies move from experimentation to production.</p>\n<p>* He emphasizes the importance of trust, security, and verifiability in enterprise AI applications.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The interview provides insights into Cohere&#39;s strategy, technology, and vision for the future of enterprise AI adoption.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhbaji/</p>\n<p>https://x.com/sbaji</p>\n<p>https://cohere.com/</p>\n<p>https://cohere.com/business</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>MLST is sponsored by Brave:</p>\n<p>The Brave Search API covers over 20 billion webpages, built from scratch without Big Tech biases or the recent extortionate price hikes on search API access.
