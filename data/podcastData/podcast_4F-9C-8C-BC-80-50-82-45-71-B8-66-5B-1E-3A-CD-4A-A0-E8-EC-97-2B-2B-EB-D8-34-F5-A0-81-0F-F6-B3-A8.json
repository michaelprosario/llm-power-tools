    "Description": "<p>In 2018, Kubernetes had become too big to run on Raspberry Pi. For a while, it meant that kubeadmin could not run on the micro-device. K3s changed that and represents a new take on Kubernetes: stripped of code, K3s is a lightweight version of Kubernetes meant to run on edge devices.</p>\n<p>Today, K3s is seeing a rise in popularity as are a host of other new services that focus on the edge for Kubernetes architectures.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s now at the point that the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is planning Kubernetes on Edge Day at KubeCon, said Bill Mulligan, marketing manager for CNCF in a podcast recording with Alex Ellis, founder at OpenFaaS and the author of a new course on K3s that will be available for KubeCon, scheduled for May 4-7.</p>\n",
