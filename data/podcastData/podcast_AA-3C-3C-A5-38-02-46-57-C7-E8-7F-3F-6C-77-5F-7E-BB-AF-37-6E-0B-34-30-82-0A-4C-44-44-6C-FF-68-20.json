    "Description": "\n        Computer scientist Tony Hsieh made millions off the dot-com boom. But he didn't make his mark until he built Zappos \u2014 a customer service company that \"happens to sell shoes.\" Now Zappos is worth over a billion dollars and known for its completely unorthodox management style. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" we check back with Mike Bolos and Jason Grohowski, who brought the office desk closer to the light by creating Deskview, a portable desk that attaches to a sheer window with a suction cup.
