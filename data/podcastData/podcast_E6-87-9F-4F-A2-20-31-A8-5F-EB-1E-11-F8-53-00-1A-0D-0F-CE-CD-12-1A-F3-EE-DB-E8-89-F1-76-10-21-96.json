    "Description": "<p>Are you ready to become Ansible? Richard chats with Josh Duffney about his book on Ansible - using a play on the term &quot;become,&quot; which is the privilege elevation command in Ansible. The conversation turns to how you evolve as an infrastructure-as-code person, doing basic automation tasks first, but ultimately turning into a source-code-controlled library-building-team that makes deployment of applications and resources easy, reliable, and powerful. If you're coming from the Windows world and trying to learn Ansible, this is the book for you!</p>\n",
