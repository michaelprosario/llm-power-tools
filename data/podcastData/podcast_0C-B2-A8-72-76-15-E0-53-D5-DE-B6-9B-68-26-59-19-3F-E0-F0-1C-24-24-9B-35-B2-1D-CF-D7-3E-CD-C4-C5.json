    "Description": "<p>Have you ever made the mistake of giving students or others the kind of feedback you want to receive - but it just falls flat? For example, I'm a \"word\" kind of person and I can float on a compliment for days. However, some people I know are visual. Others like to hear a person's voice. Still, others really love graphics or video. We all need to be excellent at giving quick and impactful feedback. Principal Meredith Akers uses many methods to give encouragement and feedback to her staff. Today you'll learn about five quick and memorable ways to make someone's day. Students, colleagues, teachers, and family will be impacted in positive ways with these ideas. Then, I hope you'll take the time to use at least one of them to encourage someone right now!</p> <p>\u00a0Get the links to these apps and ideas in the full show notes here <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e585\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e585</a>\u00a0</p> Sponsor:\u00a0The U.S. Toyota Dream Car Art Contest invites youth, ages 4-15, to submit their original hand-drawn artworks that answer the question, \u201cIf you could design a car to make the world a better place, what would it look like?\u201d Artwork submissions for this free youth art contest are accepted this year from November 1, 2019, through January 31, 2020.
