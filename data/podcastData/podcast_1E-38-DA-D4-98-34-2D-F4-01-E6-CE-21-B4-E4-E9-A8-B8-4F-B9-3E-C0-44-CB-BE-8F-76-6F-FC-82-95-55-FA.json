    "Description": "\n        <p>Humans are social creatures. We need the love and respect of our network if we want to live well-rounded satisfying lives. But how do we know our status within our network? Personal brand. This is what people say and think about you when you\u2019re not around. In this week\u2019s episode of The EntreLeadership Podcast, we sit down with Ramsey Solutions\u2019 Senior Creative Officer Tim Newton. He gives us the step-by-step process for identifying what your personal brand currently is and how you can improve it.
