Dr. Scarfe and Dennett also examine adversarial LLMs, mental trajectories, and the emergence of consciousness and semanticity in AI systems.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, they touch upon various philosophical perspectives, including Gilbert Ryle&#39;s Ghost in the Machine, Chomsky&#39;s work, and the importance of competition in academia. Dennett concludes by highlighting the need for legal and technological barriers to protect against the dangers of counterfeit AI creations.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Join Dr. Tim Scarfe and Daniel Dennett in this thought-provoking discussion about the future of AI and the potential challenges we face in preserving our civilization.
