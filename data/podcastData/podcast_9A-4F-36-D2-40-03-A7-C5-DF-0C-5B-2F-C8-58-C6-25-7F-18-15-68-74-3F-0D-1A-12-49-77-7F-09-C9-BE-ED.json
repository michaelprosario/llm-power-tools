    "Description": "<p>Professor Mark Bishop does not think that computers can be conscious or have phenomenological states of consciousness unless we are willing to accept panpsychism which is idea that mentality is fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural world, or put simply, that your goldfish and everything else for that matter has a mind. Panpsychism postulates that distinctions between intelligences are largely arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Mark\u2019s work in the \u2018philosophy of AI\u2019 led to an influential critique of computational approaches to Artificial Intelligence through a thorough examination of John Searle's 'Chinese Room Argument'</p>\n<p>Mark just published a paper called artificial intelligence is stupid and causal reasoning wont fix it. He makes it clear in this paper that in his opinion computers will never be able to compute everything, understand anything, or feel anything.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>00:00:00\u200b Tim Intro</p>\n<p>00:15:04\u200b Intro&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:18:49\u200b Introduction to Marks ideas&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:25:49\u200b Some problems are not computable&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:29:57\u200b the dancing was Pixies fallacy&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:32:36\u200b The observer relative problem, and its all in the mapping&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:43:03\u200b Conscious Experience&nbsp;</p>\n<p>00:53:30\u200b Intelligence without representation, consciousness is something that we do&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:02:36\u200b Consciousness helps us to act autonomously&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:05:13\u200b The Chinese room argument&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:14:58\u200b Simulation argument and computation doesn't have phenomenal consciousness&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:17:44\u200b Language informs our colour perception&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:23:11\u200b We have our own distinct ontologies&nbsp;</p>\n<p>01:27:12\u200b Kurt G\u00f6del, Turing and Penrose and the implications of their work&nbsp;</p>\n",
