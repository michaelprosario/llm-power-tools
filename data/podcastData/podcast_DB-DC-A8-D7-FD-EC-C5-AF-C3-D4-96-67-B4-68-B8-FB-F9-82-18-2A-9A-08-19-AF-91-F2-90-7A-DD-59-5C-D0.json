    "Description": "\n        <p>Claude 3, LLMs and testing ML performance: Jon Krohn tests out Anthropic\u2019s new model family, Claude 3, which includes the Haiku, Sonnet and Opus models (written in order of their performance power, from least to greatest). Can it stand shoulder to shoulder with other models such as GPT-4 and Gemini 1.0 Ultra? And how important is it for machine learning practitioners to try out these models with their own benchmarks? Jon walks listeners through a test of his own in this Five-Minute Friday.<br><br>Additional materials: <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/768\">www.superdatascience.com/768</a><br><br>Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?
