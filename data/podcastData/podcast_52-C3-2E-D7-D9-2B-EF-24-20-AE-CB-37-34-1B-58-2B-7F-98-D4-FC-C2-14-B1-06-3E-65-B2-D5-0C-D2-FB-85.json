    "Description": "\n        <p>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with top AI influencer, Ben Taylor. You will learn some very cool concepts about artificial intelligence such as active adverse impact mitigation, what that means and how that can help train on your dataset without bias. You will hear about AI ethics, deepfakes and Ben's current passion project, building an artificial intelligence that plays Call of Duty, which he will actually demonstrate at DataScienceGO this year at the end of September.</p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes, resources, and more at <a href=\"https://www.superdatascience.com/289\">www.superdatascience.com/289</a></p>\n      ",
