Women On The Rise was formed with the purpose of providing educational and motivational events for women, with a focus on our four pillars: women\u2019s financial literacy, career development, entrepreneurship, and personal wellness. During our interview, I asked what she is most grateful for. Her response is a sobering reminder to be grateful for life. She \"watched life exit from a person and their fight for life. and realised how much she appreciates every single breath.\"\n",
