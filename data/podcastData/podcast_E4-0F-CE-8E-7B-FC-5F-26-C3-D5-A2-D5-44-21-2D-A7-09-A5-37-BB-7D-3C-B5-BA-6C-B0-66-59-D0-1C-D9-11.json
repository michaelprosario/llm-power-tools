Kevin recognized the issue and initially approached the team with a focus on adherence to the Scrum guide, which didn't resonate. He later revised his approach, explaining the benefits, and managed to persuade the team to deliver one story in one go, although unsuccessfully at first. Through continuous effort, he introduced better story splitting, quick deliveries, and built trust with stakeholders, boosting team morale and productivity.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style= \"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">  [IMAGE HERE]  Recovering from failure, or difficult moments is a critical skill for Scrum Masters.
