Richard chats with Gareth Gudger about recent announcements from Microsoft that will have an impact on email both on-premises and in the cloud. First up is the end of Basic Authentication to Exchange Online this fall - old mail clients are going to break, time to upgrade! Next is the end of TLS 1.0 and 1.1 support - more client challenges! Gareth talks about upgrading, contracting out and other solutions for the on-going efforts to increase security to mail.</p>\n",
