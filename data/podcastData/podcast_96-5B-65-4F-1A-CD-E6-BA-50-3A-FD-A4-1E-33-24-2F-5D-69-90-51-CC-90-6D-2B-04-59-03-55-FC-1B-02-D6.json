    "Description": "<p>Microsoft has an internal lecture series called Outside in where interesting people come to talk about cool things they are working on. I got to speak to Magician David Copperfield inside his secret magic museum in Las Vegas. He's written a new book called History of Magic that's a wonderful exploration of the last 500+ years of magic. We talk about his career and the fascinating parallels between technology and magic. \u00a0</p><p>I want to personally thank David for his generosity and for letting us amplify his message on this YouTube and on the Hanselminutes Podcast.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3Ica4aRYGs\">Watch this interview on YouTube!</a></li></ul>\n",
