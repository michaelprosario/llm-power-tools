    "Description": "I have known Chris Harden through the startup ecosystem in Orlando, Florida. For us in this world, he is a bit of a legend because he appeared on Shark Tank. What landed him there was his role as Co-founder of TROBO. The Storytelling Robot, a connected plush toy that reads stories about #science and #math to children ages 2-5 using iPhones and iPads.\u00a0 When asked what his five words are that describe him, he shared Dad, husband, grateful, engineer, artistic, and creator.\nChris has another children\u2019s book that recently dropped at the end of 2023. The title is Stanley &amp; the Candy Cane Wormhole for tiny humans. Available for order on Amazon (link below). https://www.amazon.com/Stanley-Candy-Cane-Wormhole-Delivery-ebook/dp/B0CH3VTM3W\u00a0\nWe hope you enjoy this week's episode of The Intern Whisperer.
