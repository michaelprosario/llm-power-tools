    "Description": "Dara Oke graduated with four tech internships under her belt. She\u2019s worked at Intel, Microsoft, and Twitter building features in languages she hadn\u2019t studied and on topics she hadn\u2019t yet covered in school. But now as a program manager at Microsoft, she looks back at those internships as an essential part of her success and education. We talk about the day-to-day of a tech internship, how she found her place at these powerful tech companies, and how codenewbies everywhere can find their own opportunities to learn through real-world experience.
