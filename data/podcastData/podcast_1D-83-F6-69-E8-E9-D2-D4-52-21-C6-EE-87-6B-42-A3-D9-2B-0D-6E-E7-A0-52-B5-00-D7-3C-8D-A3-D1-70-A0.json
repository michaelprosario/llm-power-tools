    "Description": "\n        <p>On today\u2019s bonus episode, we\u2019re taking you back to San Diego, California, where EntreLeadership Summit is underway. Have you ever heard of a natural-born leader? Well, we hate to break it to you, but there\u2019s no such thing. Tune in as Dave Ramsey explains why leaders are <em>built</em>, not born, and what it takes to become an amazing one. Hint: It\u2019s much more than being a boss\u2014you know, the person who simply makes all the rules and signs all the paychecks. We\u2019ll also take you behind the scenes to our <em>Live From Summit</em> stage where Ken Coleman sits down to chat\u2014first with Dave, and later with speakers Dr. Henry Cloud and Patrick Lencioni. Get ready, folks. We\u2019re just getting warmed up!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/podcast\">entreleadership.com/podcast</a></p> <p>See the speaker lineup for\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.entreleadership.com/summit\">EntreLeadership Summit 2020</a></p> <p>Get your\u00a0<a href=\"https://entreleader.lpages.co/backstage-pass-opt-in/\">Backstage Pass and view exclusive content</a>\u00a0from this year's Summit</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>Want expert help with your business question?
