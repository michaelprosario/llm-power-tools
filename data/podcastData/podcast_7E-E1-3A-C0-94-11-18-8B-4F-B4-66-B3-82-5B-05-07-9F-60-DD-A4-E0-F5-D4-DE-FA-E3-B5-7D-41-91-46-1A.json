    "Description": "<p>David Spivak, a mathematician known for his work in category theory, discusses a wide range of topics related to intelligence, creativity, and the nature of knowledge. He explains category theory in simple terms and explores how it relates to understanding complex systems and relationships.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>MLST is sponsored by Brave:</p>\n<p>The Brave Search API covers over 20 billion webpages, built from scratch without Big Tech biases or the recent extortionate price hikes on search API access.

Spivak shares his thoughts on creativity, discussing where it comes from and how it might be modeled mathematically.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the impact of artificial intelligence on human thinking and its potential role in the evolution of intelligence. Spivak also touches on the importance of language, particularly written language, in transmitting knowledge and shaping our understanding of the world.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>David Spivak</p>\n<p>http://www.dspivak.net/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>TOC:</p>\n<p>00:00:00 Introduction to category theory and functors</p>\n<p>00:04:40 Collective intelligence and sense-making</p>\n<p>00:09:54 Embodiment and physical concepts in knowledge acquisition</p>\n<p>00:16:23 Creativity, open-endedness, and AI&#39;s impact on thinking</p>\n<p>00:25:46 Modeling creativity and the evolution of intelligence</p>\n<p>00:36:04 Evolution, optimization, and the significance of AI</p>\n<p>00:44:14 Written language and its impact on knowledge transmission</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>REFS:</p>\n<p>Mike Levin&#39;s work</p>\n<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=luouyakAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</p>\n<p>Eric Smith&#39;s videos on complexity and early life</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpJZw-68QyE</p>\n<p>Richard Dawkins&#39; book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;</p>\n<p>https://amzn.to/3X73X8w</p>\n<p>Carl Sagan&#39;s statement about the cosmos knowing itself</p>\n<p>https://amzn.to/3XhPruK</p>\n<p>Herbert Simon&#39;s concept of &quot;satisficing&quot;</p>\n<p>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bounded-rationality/</p>\n<p>DeepMind paper on open-ended systems</p>\n<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04268</p>\n<p>Karl Friston&#39;s work on active inference</p>\n<p>https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5299/Active-InferenceThe-Free-Energy-Principle-in-Mind</p>\n<p>MIT category theory lectures by David Spivak (available on the Topos Institute channel)</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UusLtx9fIjs</p>\n",
