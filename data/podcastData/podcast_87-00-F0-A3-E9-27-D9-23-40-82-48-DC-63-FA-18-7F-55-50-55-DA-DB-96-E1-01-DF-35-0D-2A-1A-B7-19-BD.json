    "Description": "<p>Years ago when I discussed strategy with a Disney Cruise leader, they told me that people tend to remember how an experience starts and how it ends.

Get ready to end the school year in a memorable and fun way for your students (and you!)</p> <p>Transcript and Show Notes: <a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e779\">https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e779</a></p>  \u00a0    Advancement Courses - Show Sponsor  <a href= \"https://www.advancementcourses.com/?utm_source=coolcatteacher&utm_medium=influencer&tid=4220202&utm_campaign=2022partnership&utm_content=newsletter_april\"> Advancement Courses</a> is who I chose for my professional development.
