    "Description": "<p>Evernote has been my go-to tool for over 10 years. In this productivity episode, I talk through how I'm using Evernote, how I organize my files (across all platforms), and some information on the new tasks feature in Evernote. I'll share the screenshots from Evernote into the show notes for this episode. For me, Evernote is more about organization and not collaboration. This is a peek into how I have kept my files organized for over ten years with ten ways I use Evernote now.</p> <p>The show notes include screenshots and lots of links:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e752\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e752</a>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
