    "Description": "<p>S6 Ep. 279 - A peek into Anna Nadeina\u2019s story of resilience and love for tech</p>\n<p>Tune in for a podcast that transcends boundaries, celebrates resilience, and embraces the profound impact of love. I met Anna in 2022\u00a0 through @Prepare 4 VC where she was working for a different company at the time. Fast forward a year later to 2023\u00a0 and she is a nomad that many will say has an idyllic life.</p>\n<p>She originated from Russia/Ukraine, and embraced diversity when leaving home at 16 years to attend a boarding school. This was a liberating experience that nurtured her independence. With an insatiable love for books, she continued her education in Finland and China; earning two marketing diplomas from universities in different countries.</p>\n<p>Her career unfolded across borders\u2014from her first marketing job with a powerhouse firm in China to co-founding a brand of lactation cookies in Malaysia and Singapore. Along the way, she pivoted into the culinary world, faced challenges in the male-dominated kitchen, and navigated the corporate landscape in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>Her story is a tapestry of joys and challenges of working remotely in 9 different countries, Anna\u2019s take on AI, and the struggles to find female founders of SaaS companies that can squeeze in time to share their startup stories when selling their company.</p>\n<p>Hashtags: #Podbean #YouTube #Employers4Change #E4C #internships #radio #podcast #innovation #employers #smallbusiness #business #FutureOfWork #ValenciaCollegeRadio #InternWhisperer #Podcast</p>\n",
