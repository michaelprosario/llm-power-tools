    "Description": "<p>Your organization is using Azure - but is it under control? Richard chats with Phoummala Schmitt about policy, compliance, and governance in Azure. Often moving to the cloud starts as an experiment - and then suddenly it's live! While it's great to work through governance in advance, it's not always possible. So how do you get things right? Phoummala talks about account management, monitoring utilization, security and cost controls, all key parts of good governance. Azure gives you lots of tools to get things right!</p>\n",
