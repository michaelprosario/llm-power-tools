It's not the product, right? So like AI is not the product. LLMs are not the product. A lot of people get caught up in the innovation, like the technology if you will, but people don't buy AI. People don't buy LLMs. They buy tools and products that like solve their own problems in the world. So really what you gained is like a new tool in your tool belt to solve your customer's problems, not a new thing that you can sell.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Clemens Mewald \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><h2>We\u2019re hosting the first ELC Annual Watch Party on 11/8!</h2><p>We\u2019re livestreaming the most popular sessions from the ELC Annual 2023 conference + hosting virtual roundtable discussions to connect you with eng leaders around the globe AND in your city.</p><p>Our first topic covers Generative AI & engineering leadership with Wade Chambers\u2026 no this isn\u2019t about the tech - it\u2019s about the leadership skills and competencies you need to evolve and adapt to lead in this next generation!</p><h3><i><strong>We have different events for Europe, East Coast & West Coast!
