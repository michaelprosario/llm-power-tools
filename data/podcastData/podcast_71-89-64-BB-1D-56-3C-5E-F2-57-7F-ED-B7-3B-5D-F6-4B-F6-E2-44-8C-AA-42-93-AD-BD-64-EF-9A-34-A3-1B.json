    "Description": "<p>This episode features all things security with our guest, Laura Bell Main, CEO & Founder @ SafeStack. She shares valuable strategies for building your security team & tool stack. We cover why security is a human problem based on human motivations, prioritization conversations for assessing risks, considerations for early-stage security teams, how behavior change & decision making impact security, and considerations for companies in the \u201cmessy middle\u201d phase. Laura also addresses communicating about security in terms of tech debt, recommendations for incorporating security monitoring tools, how to measure those tools\u2019 ROI, and more.</p><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradbell/\"><strong>LAURA BELL MAIN</strong></a></h2><p>With over twenty years of experience in software development and information security, Laura Bell Main (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lady_nerd\">@lady_nerd</a>) specialises in bringing security into organisations of every shape and size.</p><p>She is the co-founder and CEO of SafeStack, an online education platform offering flexible, high-quality, and people-focused secure development training for fast-moving companies, with a focus on building security skills, practices, and culture across the entire engineering team.</p><p>Laura is an experienced conference speaker, trainer, and regular panel member, and has spoken at a range of events such as BlackHat USA, Velocity, and OSCON on the subjects of privacy, covert communications, agile security, and security mindset.</p><p>She is also the co-author of Agile Application Security and Security for Everyone.</p><blockquote><p>\"The most important thing that we forget to tell folks when they're starting out in security is most of our tooling is about being more effective and efficient. It's not about doing something you can't do yourself. Security isn't about a magic box. I wish it was, it would be a lot easier if we could just buy a magic box. Done! Off we go to the beach, but what we have is a really human problem.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- Laura Bell Main \u00a0\u00a0 </p></blockquote><h2>Join us at ELC Annual 2023!</h2><p>ELC Annual is our flagship conference for engineering leaders.
