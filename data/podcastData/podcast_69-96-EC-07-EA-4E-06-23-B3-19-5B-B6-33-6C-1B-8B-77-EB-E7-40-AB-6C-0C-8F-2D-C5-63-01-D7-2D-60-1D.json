    "Description": "<p>Craig Martell shares the biggest mistakes leaders of ML teams make, what to do if you have no experience leading an ML team, key skills your ML team needs, plus different models/approaches to building an ML team. You\u2019ll hear the most expensive and time-consuming parts of ML, how to estimate timelines, unique tech debt, and how to manage expectations.</p><p><i>\u201cIf I had to give one piece of advice about starting AI in your company, one of the first people I would hire is a really great data scientist, even if they can't code. Just so they're the one who's going to start training you and helping you think about, how to gather data, how the modeling is going to work, what you're going to need, whether that feature that you want to build is even modelable in the first place...\" </i>- Craig Martell</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>ABOUT CRAIG MARTELL</strong></p><p>Craig is Head of Lyft Machine Learning. He\u2019s also an adjunct professor of Machine Learning for Northeastern University\u2019s Align program.</p><p>Prior to joining Lyft, he was Head of Machine Intelligence @ Dropbox, and led a number of AI teams and initiatives at LinkedIn, including the development of the LinkedIn AI Academy. Before LinkedIn, Craig was a tenured computer science professor at the Naval Postgraduate School specializing in natural language processing (NLP).
