This Thursday, December 6 from 1-3 pm Eastern Time, Edweek is hosting an event about personalized learning. I'll be co-hosting a panel conversation on how I help kids learn how to personalize their own learning, how we can differentiate instruction, and we'll have an \"old fashioned\" tool share at 2 pm in the room.
