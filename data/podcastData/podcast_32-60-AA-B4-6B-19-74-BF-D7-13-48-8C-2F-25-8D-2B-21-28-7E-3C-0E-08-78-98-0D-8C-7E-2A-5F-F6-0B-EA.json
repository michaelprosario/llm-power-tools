    "Description": "<p>We interview Professor Christopher Summerfield from Oxford University about his new book &quot;These Strange New Minds: How AI Learned to Talk and What It&quot;. AI learned to understand the world just by reading text - something scientists thought was impossible. You don&#39;t need to see a cat to know what one is; you can learn everything from words alone. This is &quot;the most astonishing scientific discovery of the 21st century.&quot;People are split: some refuse to call what AI does &quot;thinking&quot; even when it outperforms humans, while others believe if it acts intelligent, it is intelligent. Summerfield takes the middle ground - AI does something genuinely like human reasoning, but that doesn&#39;t make it human.Sponsor messages:========Google Gemini: Google Gemini features Veo3, a state-of-the-art AI video generation model in the Gemini app. Sign up at https://gemini.google.comTufa AI Labs are hiring for ML Engineers and a Chief Scientist in Zurich/SF.
