    "Description": "<p>In this podcast episode, Neha Singh, Founder and CEO of Obsess.vr, delves into her journey and the innovative strides her company is making in the world of e-commerce. Singh, whose background uniquely blends computer science from MIT and fashion studies from FIT, has channeled her dual expertise into founding Obsess.vr. The platform transforms traditional online shopping into immersive 3D virtual store experiences, enhancing how consumers engage with brands. Singh\u2019s career began with roles at Google and a luxury e-commerce startup, eventually leading her to Vogue, where she launched various digital products. This diverse experience provided her with insights into both the tech and fashion industries, laying the foundation for Obsess.vr. Founded in 2016, Obsess.vr partners with top-tier brands like Dior, L'Oreal, and Crate & Barrel, creating virtual shopping environments that replicate the discovery-driven shopping of physical stores. Singh discusses the shortcomings of current e-commerce interfaces, which often reduce products to small thumbnails on a white background. This setup fails to convey the brand story and the experiential aspect of shopping. Obsess.vr addresses this by leveraging real-time 3D technology to create branded, interactive virtual stores. These environments are accessible via web links and integrate seamlessly with existing e-commerce platforms, making it easy for consumers to engage with them on any device. The platform\u2019s use of WebGL and Three.js ensures fast load times and high-quality rendering, essential for keeping users engaged. Singh emphasizes the importance of creating both photorealistic and fantastical virtual environments, depending on the brand\u2019s vision. Obsess.vr also incorporates gamification elements, such as scavenger hunts and custom games, which significantly boost user engagement and conversion rates. A key aspect of Obsess.vr\u2019s strategy is its focus on accessibility and integration. The platform integrates with major e-commerce systems like Salesforce and Shopify, allowing for seamless product data synchronization and enhanced customer experiences. Singh also highlights the importance of making these virtual experiences accessible through various channels, including social media, email, and even QR codes in physical stores. Singh envisions a future where the internet is inherently 3D, with virtual shopping becoming a standard part of the online experience. Obsess.vr aims to be at the forefront of this transformation, providing brands with tools to create and manage immersive digital experiences. The company is also exploring the use of generative AI to streamline the creation of 3D models and environments, further reducing production time and costs. The podcast also touches on innovative projects like the virtual store for K18 haircare, which educates users about hair structure through interactive 3D experiences, and the use of AI in extending historical ad campaigns into immersive environments for Elizabeth Arden. Singh\u2019s approach demonstrates how brands can use virtual spaces not just for selling products, but for creating memorable, educational experiences that build long-term customer relationships. In conclusion, Neha Singh\u2019s Obsess.vr is pioneering the next evolution of e-commerce, blending cutting-edge technology with creative brand storytelling. By making virtual shopping engaging, accessible, and integrated, Obsess.vr is set to revolutionize how consumers interact with brands online, making 3D virtual stores an essential component of the future internet.</p>\n<p><p>Have any comments or questions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show Feedback@Buildingtheopenmetaverse.org</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Want more information?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Visit our website www.buildingtheopenmetaverse.org&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And make sure you follow us on Linkedin for all of our show updates&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/company/buildingtheopenmetaverse&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building the Open Metaverse is a podcast hosted by Patrick Cozzi (Cesium) and Marc Petit that invites a broad range of technical experts to share their insights on how the community is building the metaverse together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>#BuildingTheOpenMetaversePodcast #MetaversePodcast #Metaverse</p></p>",
