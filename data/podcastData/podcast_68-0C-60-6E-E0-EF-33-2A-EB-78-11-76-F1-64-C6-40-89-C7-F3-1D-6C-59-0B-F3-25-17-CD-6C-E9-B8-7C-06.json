    "Title": "Some Big AI Problems: The Eliza Effect and More",
    "SourceUrl": "https://www.coolcatteacher.com/e855",
    "Description": "<p>Yes, everyone is talking about AI. However, how do the concerns about AI apply to our classrooms today? Tom Mullaney talks about concerns with:</p> <ul> <li>The Eliza effect\u2014where people attribute human characteristics such as trust and credibility to text-generating computers\u2014can be dangerous when combined with the biases and inaccuracies inherent in large language models. It is vital for educators to understand this as we talk about AI with students.</li> <li>There are concerns about using AI as \"guest speakers\" even for something seemingly \"harmless\" like \"the water cycle.\"</li> <li>Concerns with humanizing AI.</li> <li>Discussing the \"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots\" paper by Dr. Emily M. Bender et all which discusses the ethical issues and harms of large language models, including bias and environmental racism.</li> <li>Debunking the myth that AI will have values and beliefs.</li> <li>Practical applications of AI in the classroom</li> <li>The challenges of citing generative AI in the classroom.</li> <li>Why it is vital to teach about AI's ethical implications and encourage critical thinking with the use of AI in the classroom.</li> <li>Why educators should stay informed about AI so they can guide students to effectively and responsibly use the AI that is becoming embedded in their technology.</li> </ul> <p>Sponsor: Juicemind - <a href= \"https://www.juicemind.com/\">https://www.juicemind.com/</a></p> <p>As I taught coding this year in AP Computer Science Principles, I found JuiceMind so useful. Not only do they have the team coding tools we educators need (since Replit was discontinued) but they have Kahoot-like games where students can write code as part of the quizzing process. Juicemind also works with many math courses. I\u00a0love their tools for studying in my coding classes and highly recommend Juicemind.</p> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection: This is a \u201csponsored podcast episode.\u201d The company who sponsored it compensated me via cash payment, gift, or something else of value to include a reference to their product.
