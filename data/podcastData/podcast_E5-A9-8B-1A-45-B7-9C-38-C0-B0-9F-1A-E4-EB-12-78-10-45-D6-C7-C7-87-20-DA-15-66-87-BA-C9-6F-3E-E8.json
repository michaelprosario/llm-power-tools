    "Description": "<p>Curriculum Specialist Mandi Figlioli is excited about her school\u2019s adoption of the Inventionland design and protoyping course. Mandi talks about how the course is structured, gives a story of how students are being transformed, and shares how they are re-working the course based on what they learned the first year. If you\u2019re teaching design or making, you can learn from this show.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/e163\">www.coolcatteacher.com/e163</a></p> <p>Sponsor: <a href= \"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/bookcreator\">Book Creator</a>.

Make books, send the link to parents and even include audio and video. As a teacher, you can get started with a library of 40 books as part of their free version - go to <a href=\"http://www.coolcatteacher.com/bookcreator\">coolcatteacher.com/bookcreator</a> to get started now. This is great news!
