    "Description": "<p>When Michael Preysman founded Everlane, he knew nothing about fashion\u2013he just wanted to see if he could build an online platform that would generate buzz around<em> anything.</em> He started with a cotton T-shirt, and taught himself every stage of production, from sourcing the fabric, to cutting, dyeing, and finishing. When Michael realized that some luxury brands charged as much as seven times the actual cost of a T-shirt, he decided to sell his for $15, and soon caused a stir by telling the world exactly what it cost to make. Eventually the brand shifted its focus to sustainability and social responsibility, a strategy that invited harsh criticism, especially during the Covid era. Today, Everlane is a multi-million dollar business that has expanded to sweaters, denim, outerwear, and accessories.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
