    "Description": "<p> On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Daniel Bourke. He's a Machine Learning Engineer and creator of many popular tutorials on YouTube. He's also a frequent freeCodeCamp contributor.</p> <p>We talk about:</p> <p>- How as a kid he hacked into his school's network and gave himself good grades, just like the kid from Wargames. (Don't try this at home.)</p> <p>- What he learned from helping fix 5,000 people's computers</p> <p>- How Machine Learning actually works. What the AI models are actually doing for you in the background.</p> <p>- His advice for anyone getting into Machine Learning in 2024, in terms of what to prioritize learning</p> <p>Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 2020 song by an Australian musician.</p> <p>Also, I want to thank the 9,779 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
