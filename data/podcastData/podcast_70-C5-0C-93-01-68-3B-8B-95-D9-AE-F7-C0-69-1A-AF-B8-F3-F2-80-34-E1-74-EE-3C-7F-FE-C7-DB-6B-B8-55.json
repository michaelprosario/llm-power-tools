    "Description": "<p>Kubernetes is great at large-scale systems, but its complexity and transparency has caused higher cloud costs, delays in deployment and developer frustration. As Kubernetes has taken off and workloads continue to move to a containerized environment, optimizing resources is becoming increasingly important. In fact, the recent <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/reports/cncf-annual-survey-2021/\">2021 Cloud Native Survey</a> revealed that Kubernetes has already crossed the chasm to mainstream with 96 percent of organizations using or evaluating the technology.</p><p>In this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mprovo/\">Matt Provo, founder and CEO of StormForge</a>, discusses new ways to think about Kubernetes, including resource optimization which can be achieved by empowering developers through automation. He also shared the company\u2019s latest new machine learning-powered multi-dimensional optimization solution, Optimize Live.</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/\">Alex Williams</a>, founder and publisher of The New Stack, hosted this podcast.</p>\n",
