    "Description": "<p>Richard talks with Bhargav Shukla about some of the issues he encounters with Exchange 2010 out in the field. The conversation starts out with a long discussion about the impact of mobile device, especially the tendancy today to bring your own device to work. Most users have several devices now syncing with Exchange, not just one or two. This leads to a great knowledge base article on issues with Exchange Active Sync and third party devices. Bhargav then moves onto issues around mailbox size, the impact of active directory performance and load balancing. So many challenges, but only so much time - this show is chocked full of ideas on how to make Exchange perform better!</p>\n",
