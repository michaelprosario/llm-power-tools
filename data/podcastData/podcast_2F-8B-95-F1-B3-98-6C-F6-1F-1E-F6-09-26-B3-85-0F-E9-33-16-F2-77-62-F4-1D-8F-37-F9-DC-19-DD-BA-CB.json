    "Description": "<p>When open source projects shift to proprietary licensing, forks and new communities often emerge. Such was the case with MapLibre, born from Mapbox\u2019s 2020 decision to make its map rendering engine proprietary. In conjunction with All Things Open 2024, Seth Fitzsimmons, a principal engineer at AWS and Tarus Balog, principal technical strategist for open source at AWS shared that this engine, popular for its WebGL-powered vector maps and dynamic customization features, was essential for organizations like BMW, The New York Times, and Instacart. However, Mapbox\u2019s move disappointed its open-source user base by tying the upgraded Mapbox GL JS library to proprietary products.</p><p>In response, three users forked the engine to create MapLibre, committing to modernizing and preserving its open-source ethos. Despite challenges\u2014forking often struggles to sustain momentum\u2014MapLibre has thrived, supported by contributors and corporate sponsors like AWS, Meta, and Microsoft. Notably, a community member transitioned the project from JavaScript to TypeScript over nine months, showcasing the dedication of unpaid contributors.</p><p>Thanks to financial backing, MapLibre now employs maintainers, enabling it to reciprocate community efforts while fostering equality among participants. The project illustrates the resilience of open-source communities when proprietary shifts occur.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about forking open source projects:</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/open-source-projects-fork/\">Why Do Open Source Projects Fork?</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/opensearch-how-the-project-went-from-fork-to-foundation/\">OpenSearch: How the Project Went From Fork to Foundation</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game</a>.\u00a0</p>\n",
