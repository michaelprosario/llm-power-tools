We met up in Brooklyn to talk about her journey into information security.</p> <p>She studied economics at University of Michigan before working in finance in New York City. But her ambitions lead her into cyber security \u2013 first as a threat analyst at a credit rating agency, and later as a Security Architect at a bank and a startups.</p> <p>Over the years, she's volunteered at charities around New York, and she's authored dozens of security tutorials as a contributor to freeCodeCamp.</p> <p>We talk about her journey into tech and her advice for folks getting into security \u2013 especially women.
