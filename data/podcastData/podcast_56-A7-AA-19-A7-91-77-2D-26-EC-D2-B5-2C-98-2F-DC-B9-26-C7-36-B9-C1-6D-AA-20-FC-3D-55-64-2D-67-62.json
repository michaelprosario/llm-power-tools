    "Description": "In this Five-Minute Friday, Jon Krohn looks into AI\u2019s disruption of the journalism industry and how it has fundamentally reshaped news production. Multiple news outlets\u2019 suing of ChatGPT over its use of copyrighted materials may have taken the most headlines to date, but this isn\u2019t to say news media is rebuffing AI entirely. On the contrary, several outlets have launched summarization and analysis tools for both internal and external use, such as The New York Times\u2019s Echo and The Washington Post\u2019s Haystacker. This episode looks into the ways major news outlets are utilising AI, and what this means for journalists.\n\n\n\nAdditional materials: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060www.superdatascience.com/910\u2060\u2060\n\n\n\nInterested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?
