    "Description": "\n        <p>While apple picking on a farm near Philadelphia, Abhi Ramesh learned that a massive amount of \u201cmisfit\u201d produce goes to waste. He started running ads on Facebook to see if people would pay a discount for subscription boxes filled with twisted carrots and oddly-shaped squash. &nbsp; Demand was so strong that Abhi soon hired drivers on Craigslist to deliver produce around Philly from a rented warehouse. Four months in, Misfits Market had thousands of customers and landed $2 million in venture capital to expand. The pandemic turbocharged its growth and the business evolved into an online grocery store offering 1100+ items. Today Misfits Market operates in 48 states, and was most recently valued at $2 billion.</p><p>This episode was produced by Casey Herman with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei, and edited by Neva Grant with research by Katherine Sypher.
