    "Description": "<p>In this episode of\u00a0<i>The New Stack Makers</i>, recorded at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, Alex Williams speaks with Ville Aikas, Chainguard founder and early Kubernetes contributor. They reflect on the evolution of container security, particularly how early assumptions\u2014like trusting that users would validate container images\u2014proved problematic. Aikas recalls the lack of secure defaults, such as allowing containers to run as root, stemming from the team\u2019s internal Google perspective, which led to unrealistic expectations about external security practices.</p><p>The Kubernetes community has since made strides with governance policies, secure defaults, and standard practices like avoiding long-lived credentials and supporting federated authentication. Aikas founded Chainguard to address the need for trusted, minimal, and verifiable container images\u2014offering zero-CVE images, transparent toolchains, and full SBOMs. This security-first philosophy now extends to virtual machines and Java dependencies via Chainguard Libraries.</p><p>The discussion also highlights the rising concerns around AI/ML security in Kubernetes, including complex model dependencies, GPU integrations, and potential attack vectors\u2014prompting Chainguard\u2019s move toward locked-down AI images.</p><p>Learn more from The New Stack about\u00a0Container Security and AI</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/chainguard-takes-aim-at-vulnerable-java-libraries/\">Chainguard Takes Aim At Vulnerable Java Libraries</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/clean-container-images-a-supply-chain-security-revolution/\">Clean Container Images: A Supply Chain Security Revolution</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/revolutionizing-offensive-security-a-new-era-with-agentic-ai/\">Revolutionizing Offensive Security: A New Era With Agentic AI</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/newsletter/\">Join our community of newsletter subscribers to stay on top of the news and at the top of your game.\u00a0</a></p>\n",
